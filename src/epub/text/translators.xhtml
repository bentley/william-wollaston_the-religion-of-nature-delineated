			<p><i>The Religion of Nature Delineated</i> being a book in great esteem with her late majesty Queen Caroline, she was pleased to command me to translate the notes into English for her own use: And there being a demand for a new edition, it was thought proper to publish this translation, as these notes are illustrations and confirmations of the sentiments of the learned author; and therefore I have consented to the publishing of them. </p>
			<p> ―John Clarke.<br/> Salisbury<br/> 17 April, 1750. </p>
