The Religion of Nature Delineated

To <abbr class="name">A.F.</abbr>, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>

I was much surprised, sir, when (fome time ago) you so importunately desired my thoughts upon these questions,

<ol>
<li>Is there really any such thing as <em>natural religion</em>, properly and truly so called?</li>
<li>If there is, what is it?</li>
<li>How may a man qualify himself, so as to be able to judge, for himself, of the other religions professed in the world, to settle his own opinions in disputable matters; and then to enjoy tranquility of mind, neither disturbing others, nor being disturbed at what passes among them?

With what view you did this; Whether in expectation of some little degree of satisfaction; or merely to try my abilities; or (which I rather think) out of kindness to amuse me at a time, when I wanted something to divert melancholy reflections, I shall not venture to guess. I shall only say, that could I have foreseen in due time, that such a task was to be imposed upon me, I might have been better prepared for it. I might have marked what was suitable to my purpose in those books, which I have read, but shall scarce ever return to read any more: many more I might have read too, which, not wanting them for my own conviction, I have neglected, and now have neither leisure nor patience to peruse: I might have noted what the various occurrences and cases, that happen in life, suggested: and, in general, I might have placed more of my time on such parts of learning, as would have been directly serviceable to me the present occasion.

However, as I have not spent my days without thinking and reflecting seriously within myself upon the articles and duties of natural religion, and they are <em>my thoughts</em> which you require, I have attempted, by recollecting old meditations, and consulting a few scattered papers, in which I had formerly for my own use set down some of them (briefly, and almost solecistically), to give an answer to the two first of your questions, together: tho’ I must own, not without trouble in adjusting and compacting loose sentiments, filling up vacuities, and bringing the chaos into the shape of something like a system.

Notwithstanding what I have said, in a treatise of natural religion, a subject so beaten and exhausted in all its parts, by all degrees of writers, in which many notions will inevitably occur that are no one’s property, and so many things require to be proved, which can scarce be proved by any other but the old arguments (or not so well), you must not expect to find <em>much</em> that is new. Yet <em>something</em> perhaps you may. That, which is advanced in the following papers, concerning the nature of moral good and evil, and is the prevailing thought that runs through them all, I never met with anywhere. And even as to those matters, in which I have been prevented by others, and which perhaps may be common, you have them, not as I took them from anybody, but as they used to appear to me in my walks and solitudes. So that they are indeed <em>my thoughts</me>, such as have been <em>long mine</em>, which I send you; without any regard to what others have, or have not said: as I persuade myself you will easily perceive. It is not hard to discern, whether a work of this kind be all of a piece; and to distinguish the genuine hand of an author from the false wares and patch-work of a plagiary. Though after all, it would be madness in a man to go out of his right way, only because it has been frequented by others, or perhaps is the high road.

Sensible how unfinished this performance is, I call it only a delineation, or rude draft. Where I am defective, or trip, I hope you will excuse a friend, who has now passed the threshold of old age; and is, upon that and other accounts, not able to bear much study or application. And thus I commit to your candor what follows: which, for the sake of order and perspicuity, I have divided into sections, and propositions.

Section I. Of Moral Good and Evil.

The foundation of religion lies in that difference between the acts of men, which distinguishes them into good, evil, indifferent. For if there is such a difference, there must be religion; &amp; <i xml:lang="la">contra</i>. Upon this account it is that such a long and laborious inquiry has been made after some general idea<a>, or some rule<a>, by comparing the foresaid acts with which it might appear, to which kind they respectively belong<a>. And though men have not yet agreed upon any one, yet one certainly there must be<a>. That, which I am going to propose, has always seemed to me not only evidently true, but withal so obvious and plain, that perhaps for this very reason it has not merited the notice of authors: and the use and application of it is so easy, that if things are but fairly permitted to speak for themselves their own natural language, they will, with a moderate attention, be found <em>themselves</em> to proclaim their own rectitude or obliquity; that is, whether they are disagreeable to it, or not. I shall endeavor by degrees to explain my meaning.

<b>I. That act, which may be denominated morally good or evil, must be the act of a being capable of distinguishing, choosing, and acting for himself</b>:<a> or more briefly, <b>of an intelligent and free agent</b>. (Because in proper speaking no act at all can be ascribed to that, which is not indued with these capacities. For that, which cannot distinguish, cannot choose: and that, which has not the opportunity, or liberty of choosing for itself, and acting accordingly, from an internal principle, acts, if it acts at all, under a necessity incumbent <i xml:lang="la">ab extra</i>. But that, which acts thus, is in reality only <em>an instrument</em> in the hand of something which imposes the necessity; and can-not properly be said <em>to act</em>, but <em>to be acted</em>. The act must be the act of an agent: therefore not of his instrument.

A being under the above-mentiond inabilities is, as to the morality of its acts, in the state of inert and passive matter, and can be but a <em>machine</em>: to which no language or philosophy ever ascribed <i xml:lang="grc">ἤθη</i> or <i xml:lang="la">mores</i>.

<b>II. Those propositions are true, which express things as they are: or, truth is the conformity of those words or signs, by which things are expressed, to the
things themselves.</b> Definition.

<b>III. A true proposition may he denied, or things may be denied to be what they are, by deeds, as well as by express words or another proposition.</b> It is certain there is a meaning in many acts and gestures. Everybody understands weeping,<a> laughing, shrugs, frowns, <abbr>etc.</abbr> these are a sort of universal language. Applications are many times made, and a kind of dialogue maintained only by casts of the eye and motions of the adjacent muscles.<a> And we read of feet, that speak;<a> of a philosopher, who answered an argument by only getting up and walking;<a> and of one, who pretended to express the same sentence as many ways by gesticulation, as even Cicero himself could by all his <i xml:lang="la">copia</i> of words and eloquence.<a> But these instances do not come up to my meaning. There are many acts of other kinds, such as constitute the character of a man’s conduct in life, which have <em>in nature</em>, and would be taken by any indifferent judge <em>to have a signification</em>, and <em>to imply some proposition</em>, as plainly to be understood as if it was declared in words: and therefore if what such acts declare to be, is not, they must contradict truth, as much as any false proposition or assertion can.

If a body of soldiers, seeing another body approach, should fire upon them, would not this action declare that they were enemies; and if they were not enemies, would not this military language declare what was false? No, perhaps it may be said; this can only be called a mistake, like that which happend to the Athenians in the attack of Epipol&aelig;,<a> or to the Carthaginians in their last in-



campment againﬁ ﬂgatbocler in A fee m. Suppofe
then, inﬂead of this ﬁring, some ofﬁcer to have
said they were enemies, when indeed they were
friends : would nor that sentence affirming them to
be enemies be false, notwithftanding he who spoke
it was miﬁaken ? The truth or falihood of this af-
firmation doth n0t depend upon the aH-irmer’s ‘
knowledge or ignorance : because there is a certain

‘ fenfe aﬂixt to the words, which mull either agree
or difagree to that, concerning which the affirma-
tion is made. The thing is the very fame I’till, if
into the place of words befubftituted aﬂz'mzs. The
falute here was in nature the falute of an enemy,
but should have been the falute of a friend: there-
fore it implied a falﬁty. Any ﬁxﬁaz‘or would} have
underflood this action as 'I do; for a declaration,
that the other were enemies.'-Now what is to be
underﬂood, has a meaning : and what has a mean-
ing, may be either true or false : which is as much‘
as can be said of any verbal sentence.

When ,Papiliu: Leena: 'folicited to have Cicero
profcribed, and that he might find him out and be
'his executioner ”, would not his carriage have fuf.
ﬁcientlyﬂgngﬁed to any one, who was ignorant 'of

and deferved capital puniihment; or had some way

‘false, were not his behaviour and actions ear-(ﬁve
of that which was false, or cautradiﬁiam to truth .?
It is certain he aﬁed a: if those things had been
true, which were not true, and as if those had not
been true which were true (in this conﬁﬁed the
fault of his ingratitude): and if he in words had

- [aid they were true or n0t true, he had done no
more than talk a: if they were so : why then ihould
not«to at? as if they were true or not true, when
they were Otherwife, contradict truth as much as
to say they were f0, when they'wcre not so °?

A pertinacious objeﬂor may perhaps still say, it
is the buﬁnefs of soldiers to defend themselves and
their country from enemies, and to annoy them as
Opportunity permits; and self-prefervation requires
all men not only barely to defend themselves a~
gaini’c aggreffors, but many times alfo to pro/acute
such, and only such, as are wicked and dangerous :
therefore it is natural to conclude, that they are
enemies againi’t whom we fee soldiers defending
themselves, and thpfe men wicked and dangerous,
whom we fee profecuted with zeal and ardor. Not
that those acts of defending and profecuting Abeak
or ﬁgnify f0 much : but conjeétures are raised upon
the common ﬂnfe, which mankind has of such pro-
ceedings. ﬂu]. If it be natural to conclude any
thing from them, do they not naturally convey the '
notice of something to be concluded? And what
is conveying the notice of any thing but natz'ﬁ'iug or

ﬁgnifying that thing? And then again, if this ﬁg—
niﬁcation is natural and founded in the common
principles and fenfe of mankind, is not this more
than to have a meaning which refults only from the
use of some particular place or country, as that of
language doth 2‘

If A ihould enter into a compact with B, by
which he promije: and ingages never to do some
certain thing, and after this‘he does that thing: in
this cafe it muft be granted, that his act interfere:
with his promife, and is contrary to it. Now it can-
not interfere with his promife, but it muI’t alfo in-
térfere with the truth of that propq/itz'on, which.
fays there was such a promife made, or that there
is such a compact fubﬁf’ting. If this proposition be
true, A made fuel: a certain agreement with B, i!
would be denied by this, A never made my agree-
mat witb B. Why? Becaqu the'truth of this lat-
ter is imoaﬂﬂent with the agreement allerted in the
former. The formality of the denial, or that, which
makes it to be a denial, is this inconﬂﬂente. If then
the behaviour of 11 be ineargﬂﬂent with the agree-
ment mentiond in the former proposition, that
proposition is as much denied by A’s behaviour, as
it can be by the latter, or any Otherprapqﬂtian. Or
thus, If one propoiition imports or contains that
which is contrary to what is containd in another, it
is laid to contradiﬁ this other, and denies the exi-
licence of what is containd in it. Juli so if one act
imports that which is contrary to the import of ano-
ther, it coatradiﬂ: this other, and denies it: exi-
jteme. In a word, if A? by his actions denies the in:-
gagements, to ,which he has subjected himTelf,
his aé‘tions deny-them ; juftas we say, Ptolemy by

his; and if they had not been his, but Alphondar’s
or Melibwur’s, zEgon, by an ac? very intelligible to
Dummies, had expreﬂ'ed what was not true. What
is laid here is the stronger, because he, who has the
use and difpofal of any thing, has all that he can
have of it 3 and 'v. 7;. he who has the all (or pro-
perty) of any thing, mul’t have all the uﬂe and dif-
pofal of it. So that a man cannot more fully pro-
claim any thing to be 122's, than by uﬂng it, (9’5. But

because covering the head with a hat (if it has no
inﬂuence upon one’s health) is in itself an indzﬁ-
rent thing, and people by ufage or confent may
make it interpretable either way. Such acts feem
to be adopted into their language, and may be
reckond part of it. But acts of the former kind,
such as I chieﬂy here intend, have an unalterable
ﬁgniﬁcation, and can by no agreement or force
ever be made to exprefs the contrary to it. Egan’s
treating the ﬂock, and difpoﬁng of it as if it was
his, can by no torture be brought to ﬁgnify, tiaat
it was not his. From whence it appears, that faﬂs

either aﬂirmed or denied of that according to the
nature of that relation; And further, this relation
(or, if you will, the nature of this relation) is de-

propofition that is true, but it muff likewise inter-
fere with nature (the nature of the relation; and
the natures of the things themselves too), and con-
fequently be unnatural, or wrong in nature. So very

I desire that I may not 'be mifunderl’cood in re-

it is agreeable to the will of God, that what is ill
done by them, Ihould be [a done, i. e. that they
should use their liberty ill ; but I say, when they
have done this and committed some evil, it is a-
greeable to His will, thai we ﬂiould allow it to

reét rebellion againﬁ Him, who is the Author of
nature. For it is as much as to say, “ God indeed

in any inﬂame or manner whazy'oe‘ver, withom con-
tradié‘ting axioms and truths eternal. F or such are
these : every thing 2': what it is; that which is done,

true, and which differs not from the Deity himself,

fireight, 69%. It is to fubvert all fcience, to re-
nounce all fenfe of truth, and ﬂatly to deny the exi-
ﬁence of any thing. F or nothing can be true, no-
thing does exif’t, if things are not what they are.

To talk to a paﬂ, or otherwif‘e treat it as if it was
a man, would furer be reckond an abfurdity, if
not diffraﬁz’an ‘1. Why? because this is to treat it a:
being what it is not. And Why Ihould n0t the con-
verfe be reckond as bad -, that is, to treat a man as
a pof’t '5 as if he had no fenfe, and felt not injuries,
which he dOth feel; as if to~hirn pain and for-row
were not pain ; happinef’s not happinefs. This is
what the Cruel and unjui’c often do.

Laﬂb', To deny things to be as they are is a
tranfgrefﬁon of ‘the great law of our nature, the
law of reason‘. For truth cannot be oppofed, but

Much

Much might be added here concerning the ami-
able nature ', and great force ' of truth. If I may
judge by WhatI feel within myself,, the leali truth
cannot be contradicted without much reluéiance :
even to fee other men difregard' it does something
more than difpleafe; it is fboeking.

Nothing can be aﬂ‘erted or denied by any a8:
with regard to those things, to Which it bears no
relation: and here no truth can be aﬂ'eéied. And
when acts da bear such relations to other things, as
to be declaratory of something concerning them,
this commonly is viﬁble 5 and it is not diﬂicult to
determin, whether truth fuﬁ'ers by them, or. not.
Some things cannot poflibly be done, but truth
must: be direﬂly and poﬁtively denied; and the

hing will be clear. But the cafes ariﬁng from o-
millions are not always so well determind, and
lain : it is not always easy to know wben or bow
or truth is violated by omitting. Here therefore
more latitude mull be allowd, and much must: be
eft to every one’s own judgment and ingenuity.
This may be said in general, that when any
truth would be denied by acting, the omitting to
3.4% can deny no truth. For no truth can be con-
rary to truth ‘. And there may be omiﬂions in
Other cafes, that are ﬁlent as to truth. But yet there
are joint negleﬂ: or refufals to act, which are mani-
feﬁly inconﬁflent with it (or, with some true pro-
poﬁtions). '
We before " fuppofed A to have engaged not to
do some certain thing, 65c. if now, on the Other
ﬁde, he should by some folemn promife, oath, or
Other aft undertake to do some certain thing before
such a time, and he voluntarily * omits to do it, he
would behave himself as if there had been no such
 epromife or engagement; which is equal to deny-
 ing there was any: and truth is as much contra-y
diéted in this as in the former initance.
Again, there are some ends, which the nature of
 things and truth require us to aim at, and at which
" "therefore if we do not aim, nature and truth are de-
 nied. If a man does not desire to prevent evils, and
. o be happy, he denies both his own nature and the
 nature and deﬁnition of bappineﬁ to be what they

are. And then further, willingly to negleft the
means, leading to any such end, is the fame as not
to propofe that end, and mul’t fall under the fame
cenfure. As retreating from any end commonly at-
tends the mat advancing towards it, and that may
be conﬁderd as an a&, many omiﬂions of this kind
may be turned over to the otherﬁde ", and brought
under the foregoing proposition.

It mui’c be confeﬂ: there is a diﬁculty as to the
means, by which we are to confult our own pre-'
fervation and happinefs: to know what those are,
and what they are with refpeétto us. For our abi-
lities and Opportunities are n0t equal: some labor
under difadvantages invincible: and our ignorance
of the true natures of things, of their operations
and effects in such an irregular dii’temperd world,
and of those many incidents, that may happen ei-
ther to further or break our meafures, deprive us
of certainty in these matters. But s’till we may
judge as well as we can, and do what we can ' ;
and the neglect to do tbi: will be an omiﬂion with:
in the reach of the pr0poﬁtion. '

There are omiﬂions of Other kinds, which will
deferve to _be annumerated to these by being either
total, or notorious, or upon the fcore of some other
circumﬂance; It is certain I ihould not deny the
waniﬂ'ae of Euripides to be an excellent drama by

should I, having leifure, health, and proper oppor-
tunities, read nothing, nor make any inquiries in
order to improve my mind, and attain such know-
ledge as may be useful tome, I should then deny-
my. mind to be what it is, and that knowledge to
be what it is. And if it doth n0t appear precifely,
into what kind of ﬁzudies this refpeét to truth will
carry a man-preferably-to all others, how far it will
oblige him to continue his purfuit after knowledge,
and where the difcontinuance' begins to be no of-

tunities and genius, and judge for himself a: well

before were not so well determind.

be lame by nOt taking him on my back. 7

Many things are here to be taken into conﬁdera-
tion (according to the next proposition): perhaps
I might intrench upon truth by doing this; and
then I cannot by not doing it b. But if I, being of

If I ihould not say my. prayers at such a certain
hour, or in such a certain place and manner, this
would nor imply a denial of the exiftence of God,
His providence, or my dependence upon Him:
nay, there may be reasons perhaps againft tbat par—
ticular time, place, manner, But if I ihould never
pray to Him, or worfhip Him at all, such a total
omiﬂion would be equivalent to this aﬂ'ertion,
There is no God, who govern: tloe world, to be adored :
which, if there is such a being, mul’t be contrary to
truth. Alfo. generally and notoriotg/ly to neglect this
duty (permit me to call it f0), tho n0t quite a1?
ways, will favor, if not direétly proclaim the fame
untruth. For certainly to worlhip God after this
' manner is only to worfhip him accidental! , which
is to declare it a great accident that he is worihipd
at all, and this approaches as near as it is poliible to
a total neglect. Belide, such ,a sparing and infre-
quent worfhiper of the Deity betrays such an habi-
tual difregard of Him, as will render every religi-
ous act inﬁgniﬁcant and null.

Should I, in the last: place, find a man grievouﬂy
hurt by some accident, faln down, alone, and with-
out preyont help like to perilh; or fee his 110qu on

to do it according to my ability, I deny his cafe to.

If a man ﬂeals a horfe, and rides awayiupon

But it is not neceﬂ‘ary perhaps to conﬁder what he
is_ in refpeét to his color, shape or age : because the
thier riding away with him may neither affirm
nor deny him to be of any particular color, Br. I
say therefore, that those, and all those properties,
refpefts, and circumi’tances, which may be contra-
diéted by practice, are to be taken into conﬁdera-
tion. For otherwife the thing to be conﬁderd is but
imperfeétly furveyd; and the whole compais of it

If a ricb man being upon a journey, should be
mbbed and ﬁript, it would be a fecond robbery
and injuf’cice committed upon him to take from

by the violation of them may be equally (one as
well as the other) said to be crimes, but not equal
crime: ". If A ﬁeals a book from B which was pleaf-
ing and uf'eful to him, it is true A is guilty of a
crime in not treating the book as being what it is,
the book of B, who is the proprietor of it, and one
whofe happinefs partly depends upon it: but ﬂill
if A should deprive B of a good eﬂate, of which he
was the true owner, he would be guilty of a much
greater crime. For if we fuppofe the book to be
worth to him one pound, and the eﬁate 10000].
that truth, which is violated by depriving B of his
book, is in died: violated 10000 times by robbing
him of his ‘eﬁate. It is the fame as to repeat the
theft of one pound 10000 times over: and there-

violated in the former cafe was, B had a property in
that, which gave him such a degree of happirze/ft :
that violated in the latter, B had a property in that,
which gave him a happineﬁ vaﬂiyﬁtperior to the other.
The Violation therefore in the latter‘cafe is upon
this account a vaﬁly greater violation than in the
former. La/ily, the, truths violated in the former

that whatever declines in any degree toward eitber

are several obligations, that can by no means be de-

virtues couched under the word moderation. And ‘
even as to these, it is many times difﬁcult to dif-
cern, which is the middle point m. This the author

X. If tbere be moral good and evil, di/iingui/bd a:
before, tbere is religion; and fueb a: may moji pro-
perly be flyled natural. By‘ religion I mean norhing
' elfe but an obligation to do (under which word I
comprehend acts both of body and mind. I say, to
do) what ought not to be omitted, and to forbear
what ought not to be done. So that there mutt be
religion, if there are things, of which some ought
not to be done, some not to be omitted. But that
there are such, appears from what has been said
concerning moral good and evil: because that,
which to omit would be evil, and which therefore
being done would be good or well done, ought
certainly by the terms to be done; and so that,
which being done would be evil, and implies such
abfurdities and rebellion againlt the fupreme be-
ing, as are mentiond under proposition the IVth.
ought moit undoubtedly not to be done. And then
since there is religion, which follows from the dif-
tinétion between moral good and evil; since this
diﬂinétion is founded in the refpeé‘t, which mens
acts bear to truth ; and since no pr0polition can be
true, which expreﬂ'es things otherwife than as they
are in nature : since things are so, there must: be re-
ligion, which is founded in nature, and may upon
that account be moit properly and truly called the
religion of nature or natural religion ; the great law.
of which religion, the law of nature, or rather (as

Author of nature is,

To the ﬁrﬂ objeé‘tion it is easy to reply from
what has been already said. For if the obje&or’s
enemy, whom we will. call E, was nothing more
than his enemy, there might be some force in the
objection; but since he may be confiderd as some-
thing elfe beﬁde that, he mull: be used according
to what he is in other refpefts, as well as in that
from which he is denominated the objector’s (or
O’s) enemy. F orE in the ﬁri’c place is a mom 3 and
as such may claim the beneﬁt of common huma-
nity, whatever that is: and if 0 denies it to him,
he wounds truth in a very fenﬁble part. And then
if 0 and E are fellow-citizens, living under the
fame-government, and subject to laws, which are
so many common covenants, limiting the behavi-
our of one man to another, and by which E is ex-
empt from all private violence in his body, eﬁate,
£36. 0 cannot treat E as being what he is, unlefs
he treats him alfo as one, who by, common confent
is under such a prote&ion. If he does otherwife,
he denies the exii’tence of - the forefaid laws and
public compacts: contrary to truth. And befide,

he is; a man himself, in such or such circumi’cances,
and one who has given up all right to private re-
venge (for that is the thing meant here). If truth
therefore be obferved, the refult will be this. 0
muft treat E as famet/aiag compounded of a man, a
fellow-citizen, and an enemy, all three: that is,
he mutt only profecute him in such a way, as is
agreeable to the ﬁatutes and methods, which the
fociety have obliged themselves to obferve. And
even as to legal projeeatz'om, there may be many
things still to be conﬁderd. For B may Ihew him-
self an enemy to O in things, that fall under the
cogniZance of law, which yet may be of moment
and importance to him, or not. If they are such
things, as really alfeét the fafety or happineﬂr of O
or his family, then he will find himself obliged, in
duty and fubmiﬂion to truth, to take refuge in the
laws; and to punifh E, or obtain fatisfaction, and
at leaﬂt fecurity for the future, by the means there
prefcribed. Because if he does not, he denies the
nature and jeaﬂe of happinefs to be what they are ;
the obligations, which perhaps we shall fhew here-
after he, is under to his famzZy ‘, to be what they
are ; a dangerous and wicked enemy to be danger-
ous and wicked; the end of laws, and .fociety it-
self, to be the fafety and good of its members, by

it will appear to be, when that matter comes before
us. But if the enmity of E rifes not beyond triﬁng,
or more tolerable inﬂances, then 0 might act againf’t
truth, if he should be at more charge or hazard in
profecuting E than he can afford, or the thing 1011
or in danger is worth; should treat one that is an
enemy in little things, or a little enemy, as a great
one -, or should deny to make some allowances, and
forgive such peccadillo’s, as the common frailty of
humannature makes it neceﬂ'ary for us mutually
to forgive, if we will live together. La/lbv, in
cafes, of which the laws of the place take no no-
tice, truth and nature would be fuﬂiciently ob-
ferved, if 0 should keep a vigilant eye upon the
steps of his adverfary, and take the molt prudent
meafures, that are compatible with the character
of a private person, either to aﬂ'wage the malice
of E, or prevent the effects of it; or perhaps, if
he should only not use him as a friend “. For this
if he ihould do, notwithi’tanding the rants of some
men, he would cancel the natural differences of
things, and confound truth with untruth.

The debtor in the jecoml objection, if he acts as
he lays there, does, in the ﬁrﬂ: place, make himself
the judge of his creditor, which is what he is not.
For he lays him under a heavy sentence, an incapa-

' city in eﬁ'eél: of having any eﬂate, or any more
el’tate;. In the next place, he arrogates to himself

more than can be true: that he perfeé‘tly knows, '

that is now weak, or extravagant, or very rich,

which is to be conﬁderd above all, he directly de-
nies the money, which is the creditor’s, to be the

him otherwife he is no creditor): and if it be due
to him, (he has a right to it : and if. he has a right
to it, of right it is his (or, it is bis). But the debtor

from another man his money by violence is a for-
bearance, which does n0t ﬁgnify, that I do not

fuppofe therefore the man, who wants money, to
want it for necgﬂaries, and to have incurred this
. want through some misfortune, which he could not
prevent. In this cafe, which is put as ﬂrong as can
be for the objector, there are ways- of expreﬁing
this want, or acting according to it, without tref-
paﬂin upon trurh. The man may by honef’t laéor

to such as can afford to relieve him ; or ifahis want
is very preﬂing, to the first: persons he meets, whom
truth will oblige to aﬂilt him according totheir
abilities : or he may do any thing éut violate truth " ;
which is a privilege of a val’t scope, and leaves him
many refources. And such a behaviour as 1171': is
i ‘ not only agreeable to his cafe, and expreﬁive of it
in a way that is natural; but he would deny it to
be what it is, if he did noc a8: thus. If there is no
way in the world, by which he may help himself
without the violation of truth (which can scarce be
fuppofed. If there is no other way) he mui’c e’en

HAT, which demands to be next conﬁderd,
is bappine/i ; as being in itself mof’t confider-
able; as abetting the cause of truth; and as being
indeed f0 nearly allied to it, that they cannot well
be parted. We cannot pay the refpeéts'due to one,
unlefs we regard the other. Happinefs mutt not be
denied to be what it is: and it is by the practice of
truth that we aim at that happinefs, which is true.
In the few following pr0poﬁtions I fhall not on-
1y give you my idea of it, but alfo fubjoin some ob-
fer'uatiom, which tho perhaps not neceﬁ‘ary here,
we may fometime hereafter think no lofs of time
or laborto have made en paﬂbnt: such as men of
fcience would call, some of them porifmata, or co-
rollaries, and fame febolia, Iihall take them as they
fall in my way promifcuouﬂy.

I. Plea/are is a con/ciauﬁze/i of something agree-
able, pain of the contraiy : 8: v. v. the conﬁiouﬁiefr
of any thing agreeable is pleafure, of the contraiy
pain. For as n0thing, that is agreeable to us, can
be painful at the fame time, and as such; nor any
thing disagreeable pleafant, by the term: ; so neither
can any thing agreeable be for that reafoa (because
it is agreeable) not pleafant, nor any thing difagree-
able not painful, in some meafure or other.

Obf.

Of Happinefs.’ '5‘?

Obf. I . Plea/are: and pain: are proportionable to
the perception: and fen/é of tbeir fubjeﬂs, or the per-
fom aﬂeﬁed wit/a them. For confcioufnefs and per-
ception cannot be feparated : because as I do not
perceive what I am not confcious to myself I do
perceive, ‘so neither can I be confcious of what I do
not perceive, or of more or lefs than what I do
perceive. And therefore, since the degrees of plea-
fure or pain mul’t be answerable to the confciouf-
nefs, which the party affected has of them, they
muft likewise be as the degrees of perception are.

Obf. 2. Warmer z'mreqfer tbepower of perceiving,
render: the peralpz'eﬂt more ﬂtﬂepti've of plea/are or .
pain. This is an immediate confequence ; and to
add more is needlefs : unlefs, that among the
means, by which perceptions and the inward fenfe
of things may in many cafes be heightend andz'n-
cred/Zed, the principal are rqﬂexion, and the practice
of thinking. As I cannot be confcious of what I
do not perceive: so I do 'not perceiVe that, which I
do not advert upon. That which makes me feel,
makes me advert. Every inﬁzance therefore of con~
fcioufnefs and perception is attended with an act
of advertence: and as the more the perceptions
are, the more are the advertences or reﬂexions; so
7:. v. the more frequent or intenfe the acts of ad-
vertence and reﬂexion are, the more confcioufnefs
there is,'and the stronger is the perception. Fun/yer,
all perceptions are produced in time: time paﬂ'es
by moments : there can be but one moment pre-
sent ,at once: and therefore all present perception

conﬁderd without any relation to what is paft, or
‘ E 3 future,

'54 The RELIGION of‘NA'rUnn. Se&.II.

future, may be lookd upon as momentaneous only.
In this kind of perception the percipient perceives,
as if he had n0t perceived any thing before, nor had
any thing perceptible to follow. But in reﬂexion
there is a repetition of what is pail, and an antici-
pation of that which is apprehended as yet to come :
there is a connexion of pail: and future, which by this
are brought into the fum, and fupei'added to the
present or momentaneous perceptions. Again, by
reﬂeé‘ting we praélife our capacity of apprehend~
, ing : and this practiﬁng will increafe, and as it were
extend that capacity, to a certain degree. Laﬂly, re-
ﬂexion doth not only accumulate moments pail:
and future to those that are present, but even in
their paﬂ'age it seems to multiply them. For time,
as well asfpace, is capable of indeterminate diviﬁ-
on : and the ﬁner or nicer the advertence or reﬂexi-
On is, into the more parts is the time divided ; which,
whillt the mind conﬁders those parts as so many fe-
veral moments, is in mfet? renderd by this so much
the longer. And to this experience agrees.

Obf. 3. The can/2’: of plea/are and pain are rela-
tive things : and in order to alienate truly their #23?
upon any particular fuhjet't' they ought to he drawn
into the degrees of perception in that fuhjeﬁ. When
the cause is of the fame kind, and acts with an
equal force, if the perception of one person be equal
to that of another, what they perceive muf’c needs
be equal. And so it will be likewise, when the
forces in the producing causes and the degrees of
perception in the fentients are reciprocal. For (which
doth not feem to be conﬁderd by the world, and
therefore ought the more particularly to be acted)

‘ if

‘ 0f Happinefs. '55
if the cause of pleafure or pain should aé't but half
as much upon A, as it does upon B; yet if the per--
ceptivity of A be double to that of B, the fum of
their pleafures or pains will be equal. In other cafes
they will be unequal. As, if the cau/Zz doloriﬁca
should aél: with the fame impetus on C with which
it aé'ts upon D ; yet if C had only two degrees of
perception, and D had three, the pain fuﬁaind by
D would be half as much more as that of C : be-
cause he would perceive or feel the acts and im-
preﬂions of the cause more by so much. If it should
act with twice the force upon D which it act's with
upon C, then the pain of C would be to that of D
as 2 to 6 : i. e. as one degree of force multiplied by
two degrees of perception to two degrees of force
multiplied by three of perception. And f0 on.

Obf. 4. Mn: re/‘pec‘ti've happimﬂe: or plea/urea

bear: that is, what any puniihment would be to
them. For it is certain, all criminals are not of the
former kind; and therefore should nor be used as if,
they: were. Some are drawn into crimes, which
may render them obnoxious to public justice, they
scarce know how themselves : some fall into them
thro necefﬁty, firength of temptation, defpair, e-
laﬁicity of fpirits and a fudden eruption of pallion,
ignorance of laws, want of good education, or some
natural infirmity or propenﬁon, and some who are
really innocent, are oppreﬂ: by the iniquity or mif-

power and zeal of a faction, with which their fcnfe

Time and life without thinking are next neigh—
hours to . notbz'ng, to no-time and no-life k. And
therefore to kill a brute is to deprive him of a life,
or a remainder of time, that is equal to little more
than nothing: tho this may perhaps be more appli-
cable toifome animals than to others. That, which
is chieﬂy to be taken care of in this matter, is,
that the brute may not be killed unnecelTarily ;
when it is killed, that it may have as few moments
of pain as may be I 5 and that no young be left to

Because all the moments of the pleafure muf’t bear

the degrees of intenfenefs be multiplied by the mo-
ments of duration, there must: ﬁill be some ratio
of the one produél: to the other.

That this proposition is true, appears from the
general conduét of mankind; tho in some particu-

buﬁnefs, what do all the labors and travels of men
tend to,‘ but to gain such advantages, as they think
do exceed all their trouble? What are all their ab-
ﬁinences and self—denials for, if they do n0t think
some pleafures lefs than the pain, that would ﬁle-
ceed them? Do n0t the various‘ methods of life
fbew, that men prefer one fort of pleafure to ano-
ther, and fubmit to one fort of pain rather than to
have another ? And within ourfelves we cannOt but
find an indifference as to many things, n0t caring,
whether we have the pain with the pleafure obtaind
by it, or mifs the pleafure, being excused from the
pain. i

V. When pleafare: and pain: are equal, they mu-
tually ale/troy each other : when the one exceeds, the
exaﬂ gives the true quantity of plea/are or pain. For
nine degrees of pleafure, lefs by nine degrees of
pain, are equal to nothing: but nine degrees of
one, lefs by three degrees .of the other, give ﬁx of
the former net and true.

VI. A: therefore there may he true plea/are and
pain : so there may he some pleafures, which compared
with what attend: or follow: them, not only may

kind of pleafure, which is true (clear of all difcounts
and future payments): nor can the true quantity of
pain not be the fame with that quantity of true or
mere pain. Then, the man who enjoys three de-
grees offuch pleafure as will bring upon him nine
degrees of pain, when three degrees of pain are set
oﬂ’ to balance and link the three of pleafure, can
have remaining to him only ﬁx degrees of pain:
and into these therefore is his pleafure ﬁnally re-
folved. And 13 the three degrees of pain, which
any one indures to obtain nine of pleafure, end in
ﬁx of the latter. By the fame manner of comput—
ing some pleafures will be found to be the lofs of
pleafure, compared with greater: and some pains

the alleviation of pain -, because by undergoing
' them greater' are evaded'°. Thus the natures of
pleafures and pains are varied, and fometimes tranfg
muted: which ought never to be forgot.

Nor this neither. As in the fenfe of mof’t men, I
believe, a little pain will weigh againf’t a great deal
of pleafurell’ :‘ 3 so perhaps there may be some pains,
which exceed all pleafures; that is, fuc’h pains as
no man would choose to fuﬁer for any pleafure
whatever, or at l‘eaft any that we know of in this
world. So ' that it is poﬂible the difference, -or ex-
cefs of pain, may rife f0 high as to become immenfe :'
and then the pleafure to be set againft that pain will
be but a point, or cypher: a quantity of no‘valueé,

VII. Happineﬂs diﬂ'er: not from the true quantity
of plea/are, unbappz’mﬁ of pain. Or, any being may
be find to be [0 far bappy, a: bi: plea/are: are true,
&c. That cannot be the happinefs of any being,
which is bad for him: nor can happinefs be difa-
greeable. It mull be something therefore, that is
both agreeable and good for the poﬂelibr. Now prev
sent pleafure is for the .present indeed agreeable;
but if it be not true, and he who iry'oys it mull pay
more for it than it is worth, it cannot be for his
good, or good for him. This therefore cannot be
his bappz'nefr. Nor, again, can that pleafure be reck-
ond happinefs, for which one pays the full price in
pain : because these are quantities which mntually
deﬂroy each Other. But yet since happinefsjs some-
thing, which, by the general idea of it, muft be
deﬁrable, and therefore agreeable, it mul‘c be some
kind of pleafure ‘1: and this, from what has been
laid, can only be such pleafure as is true. That only
can be both agreeable and good for him. And thus
every one’s happinefs will be as his true quantity
of pleafure.

One, that loves to make objebtz’om, may demand
here, whether there may not be happinefs without
pleafure: whether a man, may not~ be said to be
happy in refpec‘l to those evils, which he efcapes,
and yet knows nothing of : and whether there may
act be such a thing as negative happinefs. I answer,
an exemption from misfortunesand pains is a high
privilege, tho we should not be fenﬁble what those

misfortunes 'or dangers are, from which we are de-
liverd, and in the larger use of the word may be
ﬁyled a happinefs. Alfo, the abfence of pain or un-
happinefs may perhaps .be called negative happi-
nefs, since the meaning of that phrafe is known.
But in proper speaking happinefs always includes
something poﬁtive. For mere indolence refulting
from infenﬁbility, or joind with it, if it be happi-
nefs, is a happinefs inﬁnitely diminifhd: tba't is, it
is no more a happinefs, than it is an unhappinefs;
upon the‘conﬁne of both, but neither. At beﬂ: it is
but the happinefs of Rocks and Ptones ' : and to
these I think happinefs can hardly be in ﬁriétneis
allowd. ’Tisnthe privilege of a ﬂock to be what it ‘
is, rather than to be a miferable being: this we are
fenfible of, and therefore, joining this privilege
with our own fenfe of it, we call it happinefs ; but
this is what it is in our manner of apprehending it,
not what it is in the ﬂock itself. A fenfe indeed of
being free from pains and troubles is attended with
happinefs: but then the happinefs ﬂows from the
ﬂea/e of the cafe, and is a paﬁtz've happinefs. Whilﬂ:
a man reﬂects upon his negative happinefs, as it is
called, and injoys it, he makes it poﬁtive -: and per-
haps a fenfe of immunity from the aﬂiiéiions and
miferies every where so obvious to our obfervation
is one of the greatqﬂ pleafures in this world.

rﬁde, that being may be [aid to be ultimately unhappy,

IX. To make it/Ielf happy is a duty, which every
being, in proportion to its capacity, owe: to it/elf ;
and that, which every intelligent being may be fup-
pofed to aim at, in general ‘. For happinefs is form:
quantity of true pleafure : and that pleafure, which
.I call true, may be conﬁderd by itself, and so will
be jul’tly deﬁrable (according to pr0p. II, and III).

~On the contrary, unhappinefs is certainly to be a-‘

voided : because being a quantity of mere pain, it
may be conﬁderd by itself, as a real, mere evil,
8e. and because if I am obliged to purfue happi-
nefs, I am at the fame time obliged to recede, as
far as I can, from its contrary. All this is self-evi-
dent. And hence it follows, that,

truth, and denies the nature: of thing: : j?) neither
can the prazfiiee of truth make any being ultimatety

truth, oppofes the will of the Author of nature.
(whofe exiPtence, (3:. I shall prove afterwards);
and to fuppofe, that an inferior being may in op-
poﬁtion to His will hreak through the conﬁitution
of things, and by fq doing make himself happy, is
to fuppofe that being more pOtent than the Author,
of nature, and confequently more potent than the
author of the nature and power of that very being
himself, which is abfurd. And as to the other part
of the propositiongit is aifo abfund to think, that,
by the coni’titution of nature and will of its author,
any being should be ﬁnally miferable only for (one
forming himself to truth, and owning things and i
the relations lying between them to be what they
are. It is much the fame as to say, God has made
it natural to contradiét nature; or unnatural, and
therefore punifhab-le, to aft according to nature
and reality. If such a blunder (excuse the boldnefs
of the word) could be, it .muﬁ come either thro a
defeét ofpawer in Him to cause a better and more
equitable fcheme, or from some delight, which he
finds in the mifery of his dependents. The former
cath be ascribed to the Firi’t cause, who is the
fountain of power: nor the latter to Him, who

there are none of us all, who have not many injoy-
ments ‘ : whereas did he delight in the infelicity of

those beings, which depend upon Him, it muftbe ‘

natu'ral to Him to make them unhappy, and then
not one of them would be otherwife in any re-
fpeét. The world in that cafe inﬁead of being such
a beautiful, admirable fyf’tem, in which there is
only a mixture of evils, could have been only a
fcene of mere mifery, horror, and torment.

That either the enemies of truth (wicked men)
should be ultimately happy, or the religious ob-
fervers of it (good men) ultimately unhappy, is such
injuﬂice, and an evil f0 great, that fure no Mani-

he is a being unhappy or miferable, in proportion
to that excefs. Now by prop. XI. nothing Can pro-
duce the ultimate happinefs of any being, which

produce that, mul’t be something which is conﬁfto

particulars, or from them; but not by them.

In faé'l: we find Within ourfelves-many logical,
metaplagﬁtal, mathematical ideas, no one of which
is limited to any particular, or individual thing:
but they comprehend whole claﬂe: and kinds. And
it is by the help of these that we reason, and de-
monitrate. So that we know from within ourfelves,
that intelligent beings not only may have such ab-
ﬂract ideas, as are mentiondin the proposition,
but that ibme aﬁaally ba‘ve them: which is enough
for my purpose.

III. 51" 60/2 ideas or objeﬂs, that are immediate,
will ﬁe adegaately and truly known to that mind,
tuba/e ideas tiny are. For ideas can be no further the
idea: of any mind, than that mind has (or may
have) a perception of them: and therefore that
mind mult perceive the whole of them; which is
to know them adequately.

Again, there idea: being immediate, nothing (by
the term) can intervene to increafe, diminifh, or
any way alter them. And to say the mind does
not know them truly, implies a contradiction : be-
cause it is the fame as to say, that they are mifre,
presented; tbat is, that there are intervening and
mifrepresenting ideas.

' And lajtly, there cannot be an immediate per-g
' ception of that, which is not 5 nor therefor.e 9f any
immediate object otherwife, than as it is. We have
indeed many times wrong notions, and mifper-
ceptioas- of things : but then these things are not
the immediate objects. They are things, which

which may be vitiated, or perhaps are defective at
belt and incapable of tranfrnitting things as they
are in themselves, and therefore occasion imperfth
and false images; But then, even in this cafe, those
images and ideas that are immediate to the perci-
pient, are perceived as they are: and that is the
very reason, why the originals, which they should
exhibit truly, but do not, are not perceived as they
are. In ihort, I only say the mind mull: know its
own immediate ideas. ' - -

IV. What has been [aid of the/e ideas, w/oieb are
immediate, may be said ai/o of tbofe relation: or re-
ﬁoetts, which any of tb’oﬁ' ideas bear immediately each
to other :1 they met/i be known immediately and truly;
For if the relation be immediate, the ideas cannot
fubﬁi’t without it; it is of their nature : and there-‘

mutt be known too. They are in this refpeét like

and examples of others, without knowing what it
is, that gives the folidity even to their own juﬂ

This, by the way, helps us to. dete& the cause,
why the generality of pe0ple are f0 little under the
dominion of reason : why they facriﬁce it to their in-
terefts and pafiions so eaﬁly ; are so obnoxious to
prejudices, the inﬂuence of their company, and
din of a party ; f0 apt to change, tho the cafe re-
mains the very fame; so unable to judge of things,

Again; it should be obferved, that what I have
said of reasoning, chieﬂy belongs to it as it is an
internal Operation. When we are to present our
reasonings to others, we must: transfer our thoughts
to them by such ways as we can. The cafe is to be
Rated in a manner suitable to their capacities; a
-fair narration of matters of fact, and their circum-
ﬁances, to be made ; many times persons and things
to be defcribed by proper (ﬂame/2:, and the like :
all which are additional labor, and take-up much
room in difcourfes and books, and are performed
by different authors, upon different subjects, and
in different kinds of writing, with an inﬁnite va-
riety of methods and forms, according to mens
different views and capacities -, and many times not
without a necefiity of fame condefcenﬁons, afciti-
tious advantages, and even applications to the paf-
lions. But n0twithﬂzanding this, in Itriéi reasoning
nOthing is required, but to lay s’teps in a due order,
firmly connected, and expreﬁ properly, without
ﬂourilh m; and to arrive at truth by the jbortcﬂyand

Once more; perhaps difputacious men may say

And then the fenfe of this proposition mutt be this;
that there is sugh a use to be made of this power,

seems to be taken for thole general truths, of which
the mind poli'eﬂ‘es itself from the intimate know-

be to show there is such a thing, by the manner of

And further, if this proposition be not true,
there is no right r'eafoning in Euclid; nor can we
be fure, that what is there demonltrated, is true.
But to say this I am fure is abfurd. Nor do I de-
fire, that this pr0poﬁtion, which I here maintain,

diﬁinguiih‘ it from that, which wrongfully aITumes
that appellation. Nor, moreover, do I say, that by

that would imply an extent of knowledge, which

such a thing as right reason, and truth difcover-

cause; because to him norhi’n'g can be right, that
interferes. with f reason, and nothing can interfere
with truth, but it muﬁ interfere with reason. Stieh
a harmony there is between them. For whatever is
known to be true, reafo'n either finds it, or allows
it to be such. Nothing can be taken for true by a
rational being, if he has a--reason to the contrary.

religion, which may‘alfo upon this ﬁthher account
properly be called natural. For certainly'to obey
the law, whieh the Author of his being has given‘
him, is religion : and to obey the law, which He
has given or reveald to him by making it to refult'
from the right use of his own natural faculties,mull: /
be to him his natural religion. '3 . A ca'reful-obfer-’

Probability, or that, which in this cafe may in-
cline one to believe any proposition to be true ra-
ther than false, or any thing to be rather than not
to be, or the contrary, .will generally lhew itself up-
on the application of these and such like rules.~
I. That may be reckond probable, which, in the
el’timation of reason, appears to be more agreeable
to the canﬂitutz'on of nature. No body can certain-
ly foretell, that [ice-ace will come up upon two
dies fairly thrown before ambsvace: yet any one
would choose to lay the former, because in nature
there are twice as many chances for that as for the
Other. If a [trolling wolf should light upon a lamb,
it is not evidently known, that he will tear the
lamb : but there is such a natural propenfion in that
kind to do it, that no body would much question
the event. (This inﬂance'might have been taken
from amonglt men, who are generally, as far as
they can be, wolves one to another.) If a parent
causes his child to be inﬂruéted in the foundations
of useful learning, educates him virtuouﬂy, and
gives him his [hit impulfe and direction in the
way to true happinefs, he will be more likely to
proceed and continue in it 3 . than he would be to
hit upon it, and continue in'it too, if he was left
to himself to be carried away by his own paﬂions,
or the inﬂuence of those people, into whofe hands
he might fall, the bias of the former lying towards
vice, and mifery in the end, and the plurality of .
the latter being either wicked or ignorant or both.

the ﬁr]! is that which deferves the principal re-
gard: the other two are of use, when nature so uta
terly excludes us from her bofom, that no oppor-

when nature, the frequent repetition of the fame
' event, and the opinion of the belt judges concur
to make any thing probable, it is so in the higheﬁ:
degree.

It appears from what has been said concerning
the nature and foundations of probability, that the
force of it refults from obfervation and reason to-

ther. For here the one is n0t fuﬂicient without-
the other. reason without obfervatian wants mat-

be made juﬂly by ourfelves, nor to be rightly cho-
fen out of those made by others, nor to be aptly
applied, without the aﬂif’cance of reason. Borh to-

knowledge and experience, than others can ufually
have: and therefore, if through want of capacity
or honei’ty they do n0t either lofe, or belie their
opportunities and experience, they are in refpeﬂ:
of th’ofe things, to which they have been bred and
inured, more to be relied upon. And, lai’tly, Inﬂa-
rie: written by credible and indufirious anthers,
and red with judgment, may fupply us with ex-
amples, parallel cafes, and general remarks, proﬁt-g

And by the frequent perufal of them, and medi~
tation upon them a dexterity in judging of dubious
earths is acquired. Much of the temper of man-
kind, much of the nature and drift of their counv
fels, much of the courfe of Divine providence is
viﬁble in them. .
To conclude; that we ought to follow proéabi-
lit], whenfcertainty leaves us, is plain: because
then it becomes the only light and guide we have.
For unlefs it is better to wander and ﬂuctuate in
abfolute uncertainty than, to follow such a guide;
unlefs it be- reasonable to put out our candle, be,
caqu we have not the light'of the fun, it must: be
reasonable to direct our ﬂeps by probability, when
we have nothing clearer to walk by. And if it be
reasonable, we are obliged to do it by’ prop. XL
When there is nothing above probability, it doth
govern; when there is nothing. in the appoﬁte

at all) to lay on that ﬁde : nor could he not choose
to do it. Tho he would not be certain of the chance,
he would be certain of his own obligation, and on
which ﬁde it lay. - ,

Here then is another way of difcovering, if not
truth, yet what in practice may be fuppofed to be
truth. That is, we may by this way difcover, whe-
ther such propositions as these be true, I ought to
do this, rather than that; or, to think fa, rather
than the contrary. ‘ _

Ohf..I have done now what I chieﬂy intended
here. But, over and above that, we may almoil:
from the premiHES collect,

Firﬂ, the principal causes of error, which I take
to be such as these. 1. Want of faculties; when
men pretend to judge of things above them. As
some (ﬁraying out of their proper element, and
falling into the dark, where they find no idea: but
their own dreams, come to) aﬁ’ert what they have
no reason to aﬁert: so others deny What there is
the highei’c reason to believe, only because they
- cannot comprehend it. 2. Want of due reﬂexion up-
on those idea: we have, or may have: by which it
comes to pals, that men are deﬁitute of that know-‘-
ledge, which is gaind by the contemplation of
them, and their relations; mifapply names, con;
fusedly : and fometimes deal in a set of words and
phrafes, to which no idea: at all belong, and which
have indeed no meaning. Of kin to this is, 3.
Want of proper qualiﬁcations and warwexipara.

conﬁned themselves to one fort of literature, lanch
out into another: unfuccefsfully all. 4.. Not un-
deri’tanding in what the nature and force of a juit
ton/Equine conﬁits. Nothing more common than
to hear people aﬂ'ert, that such a thing follows from
such a thing; when it doth not follow: i. e. when
such a confequence is founded in no axiom, no
theorem, no truth that we know of. 5. Defects of
memory and imagination. For men in reasoning.
make much use of these: memory is upon many
occasions confulted, and fometimes draughts made
upon the pbantaﬁ'. If then they depend upon these,
and these happen to be weak, clouded, perverted
any way, things may be mifrepresented, and men
'led out of the way i by mif-shapen appari‘tions.
There ought to be therefore a little di/iruﬁ of these

faculties, and such proper helps ought to be used,
as perhaps the bdijudgment: want the moit. 6. At-_

tributing too much to ﬂnﬁ. For as neceITary as ‘
our fenfes are to us, there are certainly many

things, which fall not within their nOtice; many,

which cannot be exhibited after the manner of fen-
ﬁble objeéts, and to which no images belong. Eve-
ry one, who has but juit faluted the mathema—

‘tics and philosophy, mui’t be convinced, that there

are many things in nature, which feem abfurd to

cep't it so put from others. A fmall addition or

are to get their bread, before they have ever con-
ﬁderd them; and then making the fubfequent bu-

be in the right, it is luck, and part of their por.
tion, not the effect of their improvements : and if
they happen to be in the wrong, the more they
ftudy, and the more learning they get, the more
they are confirmed in their errors; and having set
out with their backs upon truth, the further they
go, the more they recede from it. Their know-
ledge is a kind of negative quantity, so much worfe
or lefs than no knowledge. Of this fort there are
many: and very few indeed (with refpeét to the
bulk of mankind), whofe determinations and te-
aent: were ever in the form of questions: there
could not otherwife be [0 many feéts and diﬁ'erent
denominations of men, as there are, upon the face .
of the earth. The sum of all in a few words is this :
. many qualiﬁcations are requiﬁte in order to judge
of some truths, and particularly those which are of
greatq/i importance : proper learning and penetration,
vacancy from bufinefs, a' detachment from the in-
tereﬂ: of all parties, much sincerity and a perfect
rgﬁgnatz’on to the government of reason and force of
truth; which are things not to be reconciled with
the ufual ignorance, paﬂions, tumultuary lives,
and other circumﬁances which carry molt men

, ‘ HER E remains yet another quei’tion, sup-

'pofed alfo to be propofed by an objeétor,
which must: not be forgot ; and upon which I shall
beﬁow this very 'fhort feétion. The queftion was
this, If a man can find out truth, may he not want,
the power of atting agreeably to it .?

I. Nothing is capable of no ohligati'on. For to Ob!
lige nothing is the fame as not to oblige.

II. So far a: any heing has no power, or opportn:
nity'of doing any thing, so far is that heing incapable
of any ohltgation to do it : or, no heing is capahle of
any ohltgation. to do that, which it has not power or
opportunity to do. For that being, which has not
the faculties or opportunity neceffary to the doing
of any thing, is .in refpeél: of that thing a being jut-
terly unactive, no agent at all, and therefore as to
that ad: nOthing at all.

To require or command one to do any thing is
to require him to apply a power fuperior t6 (the
reﬁi’tence to be met with in doing it. To require
him to apply fueh a power is the fame as to ‘ re:
quite that his power of such a kind and degree he
applied. But if he has no such power, then his .
power of that kind and degree is nothing : and it is
nothing, that is required to be applied. Therefore
nathing is required to be done. It is just the fame;
as if a man was commanded to do something with
his third hand, when he has but two: which would

be the fame as to bid him to do it with no hand,
or not bid him do it. ' .
Without more ado, it is a truth confeft by every
body, that no body is obliged to impoﬂibilities.
- From hence will follow, after the manner of co‘
nollaries, the two following propositions;

III. Inanimate and unabtive beings are capable
no obligation : nor merely fenﬂtive of any obligation
to all upon principles, or motives above fen/2’.

lIV. T be obligations of beings intelligent and aﬂive
muff be proportionable to tbeir faculties, powers, op.

portunities; and not more.

V. T o endeavour mayﬁtly exprefs tbc u]? of all the
opportunities and powers, tbat any intelligent and ac-
tive, but imperfebt, being batb to all. F on: to endea-
vour is to do what one can : and this as every
ﬁach» being may do, wherever he slands in die feale
of imperfeéts, so none can do more. Om: may exert
his endeavours with. greauer advantage or fuccefs,
than another ; yet ftill they are but endeavours.

. VI; Tbe imputation: of moral good and evil to be.
ings capable of underﬂanding and ailing mu/l be in prai-
portion to their endeavours : or, tbeir obligations reacb’,
as. far as.’ their endeavours may. This follows again
from what has been said: and so doesthis,

VII. and laﬂly, Tbey who are capable of di corni-
ing truth, tbo not all truths, and of ailing conformi-
'ablyto it, tbo not always or in all cafes, are never;

Thus thegeneral duties of rational beings, men-

are brOUght together,_ and ﬁnally ﬁxt under the for.

is the fum of their religion, from thich no ex.

every one ought to be in came/2; and to exert hind;

And now needlefr to me feem those difputes a;

Supreme being ; yet when it is once done, the rela-

there is between A and the idea of one who has
committed such a fact, is a ﬁxt relation.. From

Since it has bew already proved, that corporeity
is inconﬁﬁent with Divine perfeétion, tho matter
ihould be inﬁnitely extended, or there should be an
inﬁnite quantity of it, yet I’till where ever it is, it
carries this incon/iﬂence along with it.

If to matter be added inﬁnite duration, neither
does this alter the nature of it. This only fuppofes '
it to be eternally what it is, i. e. eternally incapable

XIII. It is [o far from heing true that God is cor--
poreal, that there could he no such thing a: eithet‘
matter or motion,  there was not fonze Superior he-f
ing, upon whom they depended. Or, God is such a he-'
ing, that without Him there could he neither matter
nor motion. ‘ This mui’t be true of matter : becaqu it
has been proved already, that there can be hut one
independent being; that he is incorporeal; and that
the exil’tence of all other beings muft depend upon-
Him. But the fame thing may be proved other-r
wife. If matter (I mean the exil’tence of it) does
not depend~upon something above it, it muit be
an independent being; and if an independent be-
ing, a neceﬂ‘ary being; and then there could be
no such thing as a vacuum : but all bodies mul’t be
~perfett‘ly folid ; and, more than that, the whole
world could be but one such body, ﬁve times as
firm as brafs, and incapable of all mOtion. For that
being which exiﬂs neceﬂ'arily does neceﬂ'arily exi/t :
that is, it cannot not exi/t. But in a vacuum matter
does not exil’t.

Moreover, if matter be an independent, necef—
fary being, and edits of itself, this mutt be true of
every particle of it: and if f0, there could nOt only

be no vacuum but every particle mui’t be every
wbcre. For it could not be limited to occupy only
a place of such certain dimenﬁOns by its own na-
ture; since this conﬁnement of exif’tence within
certain bounds implies non-exil’tence in other places.
beyond those bounds, and is equal to a negation
of exiﬂenceg. and when cxi/lcnco is elfential to any
being, a ngation of oxiﬂenco cannot be so. Nor, in
the next place, could its exil’tence be limited by
any tbing elfe, because it is fuppofed to have its exi-
ﬂence only of itself; i. e. to have a principle of exi-
ﬂzence in itself, or to have an exiﬂence that is not
dependent upon or obnoxious to any other. '
° And I may add ﬁill, if matter be self-exiﬁent,’
I do not fee, not only how it comes to be rcl’traind
to a place of some certain capacity, but alfo how‘
it comes to be limited in other ref/path; or why it
should not exiﬁ: in a “manner that is in all rig/path
perfect. So that thus it appears, matter muﬁ: de-
rive its exiﬂence from some other being, who causes
it to be jui’c what it is. And the being, who cando
this, mui’t be God. A . '
- It is to no purpose to object here, that one can-'
n0t conceive, how the exiitence of matter can be
derived from another being. For God being above
our conceptions, the manner in which He operates,
and in which things depend upon" him, mui’t alfo
be unconcei‘vablo. reason difcovers, that this Viﬁ-
ble world mul’c owe its exif’tence to some inviﬁble
Almighty being; i. c. it difcovers this to be fact,
and we mutt not deny facts because we know not
bow they. are effected. It is far from being new,
that our facultks should dilclofe to us the exiltence

of things, and then drop us in our inquiry bow they
are. Thus much for matter.

_ As for motion; without a F irﬂ: cause, such as has
been defcribed, there could be none : and much lefs
ﬂab motionsas we fee in the world. This may be
immediately deduced from the foregoing para-
graphs. For if matter itself could not be without
ﬁnch a cause, it is certain motion, which is an aﬂ'ec-
tion of matter, could never be. _ ,

. But further, there could be no motion, unlefs ei-
ther. there be in matter itself a power of hgz’nning
it s or it is communicated from body to body in an,
white fmceﬂion, or in a circle, and so has no begin-
ning; or elfe is ' produced by some incorporeal be-
ing. or beings. Now as hardy as men are in ad;
mcing opinions that favor their vices, tho never
ﬂ) repugnant to reason, I can hardly believe any
one will aﬁ'ert, that a parcel of more matter (let it
be great or fmall, of any ﬁgure whatfoever, 55:.)
left altogether to itself, could ever of itself begin to
move. If there is any such bold aIIErtor, let him
ﬁx his eyes upon some lump of matter, ex. gr. 3
ﬁne, piece of timber, or' a clad (cleard of all ani-
mals), and peruse it well ; and then alk himself fe-
riouﬂy, Whether it is poﬂible for him in earnel’c to
Jolie've, that that ﬂone, log, or dad, tho nothing cor-
poreal or incorporeal should excite or meddle with
it, might some time or other of itself begin to creep.
However, to be lhort, a power of ogirming motion
is not in the idea of matter. It is paﬂive, as we fee,
to the impreﬂions of motion, and fufceptiveof it ;
but cannot produce it. On the contrary, it will al«

or ﬂops it. Nor is there any thing in all phyﬁcs
better fettled than that, which is called vi: inertia,
or the inertia of matter.

The propagation of motion from body to body,
without any Fin/2 mover, or immaterial cause of mo-
tion, has been proved impoiiible, prop. I.

The fuppoﬁtion of a perpetual motion in a tin]:
is begging the question. For if A moves B, B
moves C, and scon to Z, and then Z moves A ;
this is the fame as to say, that A . moves A, by the
intervention of B, C, D, - -.- - Z : that is, Ame:
it/éif, or can begin motion °.

It remains then, that all corporeal motions come
originally from some mover incarporeal -: which
must: be either that Supreme and self-exiﬁing ﬂirit
himself, who is'God; or such, as will put us into
the way how to find, that there is such a Being.

again do others ; and know these morion‘s to fp‘ring
from the Operations of our minds: but then we
know alfo, that we have not an independent power
of creating motion. If we had, it could not be so
limited as 'our loco’motive faculties are, nor con-
ﬁned to fmall quantities and certain _circum&ances
only: we should have had it from eternity, nor
could we ever be deprived of it. ‘36 that we are

Higher being, who is able not only'ﬁto produce mo-A

fame Superior, that furnifh them with the power
of doing this. And granting it to  done eitber of
these ways, we can be at no great diﬁance from a
demonﬁration of the exi/lenee of a Deity.

' It may perhaps be said, that tho matter has not

This mighty building _is not only thus grand,
and the appearances ﬂ'upendous in it, but the man-
uerin which things are effected is commonly un-
intelligible, and their causes too profound for us.
There are indeed many things in nature, which we
know 3 and some, of which we feem to know’ the
tau/e: : but, alas ! how few are these with refpeét
to the whole fum? And the causes which we all
ﬁgn, what are they? Commonly such, as can only
be expreﬂ'ed in general terms, whili’t the lottom:
of things remain unfathomable. Such, as have been
collected from experience, but could scarcely be
known beforehand, by any arguments o‘ priori, to
be capable of rendering such effects : and yet till
causes are known after that manner, they are not
tborougloly underﬂood. Such, as feem difpropor...
tionate and too little, and are so infuﬂicient and un-
fatisfactory, that one cannot but be inclined to
think, that something immaterial and inviﬂole must:
be immediately concerned. In ihort, we know
many times, that such a thing will have such an
effect, or perhaps that such an effect is produced
by such a cause, but the manner bow we know
not ; or- but grofly, and if such an bypotbcﬂ: be true.

any notion of (as animal fpirits, or particles of light),
have their parts, and may for ought we know be
compound bodies : and as to the fubﬂanm' them.
selves of all these things, and their internal conﬂi-
tution, they are hid from our eyes. Our philosophy
dwells in the furface of» nature.

However, in the next place, we ourfelves can-
not but be witneﬂ'es, that there are ﬂated metborb,
as so many set forms of proceeding, which‘things
punélually and religioqu keep to. The fame tau/es,
circumftanced in the fame manner, have always the
fame fuccefs: all the fjmier of animals, among us,
are made according to. one general idea; and so are
those of plant: alfo, and even mineral: : no new ones
are brought forth or arifen any where : and the old
are preferved and continued by the old ways.

we do not know the true cause, which produced

other: : the uses of some are known now, that were
not known to any body formerly : the uses of many
may be difcoverd hereafter : and those of some
other things may for ever remain unknown to all
men, and yet be in nature, as much as tbofe difco-
'verd were before their difcovery, or are now in re-
fpeét of them who know them not. Things have
not therefore no uses, because they are conceald
from us. Nor is nature irregular, ‘or without me-
th‘od, because there are some ﬁetning deviations
from the common rule. Thefe are generally the
cﬁeﬂs of that inﬂuence, which free agents and va-
rious circumﬂ‘ances have upon natural producti-
ons -, which may be deformed, or hurt by external
impreﬁonss heterogeneous matter. introduced, or
difagree‘able and unnatural motions excited : and if
the cafe could be truly put, it would no doubt ap-
pear, that nature proceeds as regularly (or the laws
of nature have as regular an effect), when a men/ler
is produced, as when the ufual iﬂ'ue in common
' cafes. Under these circumﬁances the monﬂer is the
genuine iﬂue: that is, in the fame circumftances
there would always be the fame kind of produéli-
on. And therefore if things are now and then mif-
ﬂmped, this infers no uniteadinefs or miﬁake in na-
ture. Beﬁde, the magniﬁcence of the world admits
of some, perturbations; not to say, requires some
variety. The quei’tion is, Could all those things,
which we do know to have uIE-s and ends, and to the

particulars, what are those feemingly uselefs or
monf’trous productions in refpeé‘t of the reﬂ, that
plainly declare the ends, for which they were in-
tended, and that come into the world by the ufual
ways, with the uﬁzal perfection of their several
kinds? If the comparifon could be made, I verily
believe these would be found to be almol’c inﬁni-

They, who content themselves with words, may
afcribe the formation of the world to fate or na-
ture, as well as to cbnnce, or better. And yet fate,"
in the ﬁrﬂ place, is nothing but a [arias of events,
conﬁderd as neceﬂ'arily following in some certain-
Order; or, of which it has always been true, that
they would be in their determinate times and places..
It is called indeed a [cries of can/é: ‘ : but then they
are such causes as are alfo eﬁﬂr, all of them, if
there is no‘ F irit cause; and may be taken for ﬂab.
So that in .this defcription is nothing like such a;

causes of their exii’tence, or of their being as they

the parents ; and yet it, the animal itself, may not
be originally begun in them, or traducedlfrom
them. This hyporheﬁs (which has long been mine)
fuggef’ts a reason, why the cbild is fometimes more
like the fatber, fometimes the mother; viz. be-
cause the veiTels of the animalmlnm are difpofed to
receive a greater proportion of aliment fometimes
from the one, fometimes from the other : or the
ﬂuids and fpirits in one may ferment and Operate
more ﬂrongly than in the Other, and so have a greater
and more ﬁgnal effect. (Here it ought to be ob-
ferved, that tho what the animaloulum receives from
the father, is in quantity little in refpeé't of all that
nutriment, which it receives by the mother; yet
the former, being the ﬁri’t accretion to the original
' ﬂamina, adhering immediately, and being early in-
terwoven with them, may affect it more.)

Since there cannot be a proper traduﬂion of the
child (one mind, and one body) from borh the two
parents, all the ﬁmilitude it bears to one of them
mun proceed from some such cause as I have af-
ﬁgned, or at leaﬂ: not from tradnﬂion. For the
child being fometimo: like. the father, and jomtinm
the mother, and the traduétion either always from
the father, or always from the mother, there muft
fometimes be ﬁmz’lz'tude, where there is no traduﬂi-
on: and then if the child may refemble one of them
without it, why n0t the Other too? The account
I have given, appears, many times at leai’t, to be
true in plants, which raised from the fame feed, but
in défirerent beds and foil, will differ. The different
nutriment introduces some diverﬁty into the feed

_ or original plant, and aﬂimilates it in some meafure
to the reﬂ: raised in the fame place.

The other thing, whichJ take to be one of the
principal fupports to this doétrine of traduﬂion (a
ﬁappoﬁtion, that the foul is merely material, or but
she refult of some difpolition in matter) has'been
undertaken to be refuted hereafter. But I may pre-
mife this here: tho we can have no image of a [pi-
frit' (becaqu no being can be portraid or repre-
fented by an image, but what is material), yet we
may have reason to aﬂiert the exiftence ofﬁzcb a sub-
ﬁance °. Matter isa thing, which we converfe with,
of which we know pretty well the nature, and pro-
perties ; and since we cannot find among them any
that are cogitatiw, or such a thing as life, but fe-
veral things inconﬂ/ient with-them, we are under a.
necessity of confeﬂing that there is some 041m fpe-
.cies of fubﬂance beﬁde that which is corporeal,
and that our foul: are of that kind (or rather of one
of those kinds, which are not merely corporeal:
for there muﬁ‘be more than one), tho we can draw
no image of it in our own minds. Nor is it at all
furpriﬁng, that ..we should not be able to do this :
for how can the mind be the object of itself P? It
may contemplate the body which it inhabits, may
be confcious of its own acts, and reﬂect upon the
ideas it finds : bUt of its own fubﬁance it can have
no adequate notion, unlefs it could be as it were
.objeo‘i‘ and fptﬂatorbOth. Only that perfect Being,
pvhofe knowledge is inﬁnite, can thus intimateb

They, who found the traduﬂion of the foul up-
on this prefumption, that it is mate‘rial, and at:-
tends the body as some part or affection of it, feem
further to be molt wofully miﬁaken upon this ac-
count: because the body itﬁzlf is not propagated
by traduétion. It 7 paﬂ‘es indeed tbrougb the bodies
of the parents, who afford a tranﬁtory habitation
and fubﬁﬁence to it: but it cannot be farmed by
the parents, or grow out of any part of them. For
all the vital and qﬂéntz'al parts of it mul’c be one co-

wither and decay again for lack of nourifhment
received by proper velTels ; as we fee the limbs and
organs of animals do, when the fupply due from
the animal oeconomy is any way intercepted or ob-
i’trué‘ted. And since an organized body, which re-
quires to be thus ﬂmultaneozﬂy made (fafhiond as
it were at one ﬁroke) cannot be the effect of any
natural and gradual process, I cannot but conclude,
that there were animalcula of every tribe originally
formed by the almighty Parent, to be the feed of
all future generations of animals. Any other man-
ner of production would be like that, which is
ufually called equivocal or fpontaneous generation,
and with great reason now generally exploded. And
it is certain, that the analogy of nature in other
inﬂances, and microchpical obfervations do abet
what I have said ﬂrongly.

that tho many. inundations, great earthquakes, vul-'
cano’s and ﬁery eruptions have been in particular
countries; yet there is no memory or tel’timony of
any such thing, that has ever been universal ‘, ex-
cept perhaps of one deluge : and as to that, if the
genius of the language in which the relation is
deliverd, and the manner of writing hiﬂory in it
were well underﬂood, bme labord and molimi~
nous attempts to account for it might have been
prevented. And beﬁde that, the fame record, which
tells the thing was, tells alfo how immediately God
was concernd in it; that some persons actually
were faved ; and that the people who then perifhd,
as well as they who furvived, all descended from

This proposition has in efl'eé‘t beeh proVed al-
ready “. However Iwill take the liberty to inlarge
a little further upon it here. As our minds are
ﬁnite, they cannot without a contradiction com—
prehend what is inﬁnite. And if they were inlarged
to ever so great a capacity, yet so long as they re-
tain their general nature, and continue to be of the
fame kind, they would by that be only renderd able
to apprehend more and more ﬁnite ideas; out of
which, howfoever increade or exalted, no poﬁtivc
idea of the perfeﬂion of God can ever be formed,
For a Perfeﬂ being must: be inﬁnite, and perfeétly'
One: and in such a nature there can be nothing
ﬁnite, nor any tompqﬂtien of ﬁnites.

How should we comprehend the nature of the
Supreme incorporeal being, or how He exiﬁs, when
we comprehend not the nature of the mof’c inferior
fpirits, nor have any conception even of matter it-
self divef’ted of its accidents P How ihould we at-
tain to an adequate knowledge of the Supreme au-
thor of the world, when we are utterly incapable
of knowing the extent of the world itself, and the
numberlefs undefcried regions, with their several
flares and circumftances, containd in it, never to
be frequented or viﬁted by our philosophy; nor
can turn ourfelves any way, .but we are ﬁill ac-
cOf’ted with something above our underflanding?
If we cannot penetrate so far into mfetts, as to dif-
cover them and their nature thoroughly, it is not
to be expected, that we should, that we can eVer be

Can conceive.

However, notwithl’canding our own defefts, we
may poﬁtively affirm there can be none in God:
since He is perfec‘t, as we have seen, He cannot be

Underﬂood and rememberd: viz". that from Him

XVIII. God, «who gives exiﬂence to the world,
does alfo govern it by Hi: providence. Concerning
this grand queltion, W betber there is a Divine pro-
bidence, or not, I use to think, for "yr/Elf, after the
following manner.

Fiﬁ}, The world may be said to be governed (at
leaﬂ: cannot be laid to be dquégvan, or left to.
ﬂuctuate fortuitouﬂy), if there are laws, by which
natural can/2’: act, the several pbanomena in it fucy
coed regularly, and, in general, the conl’titution of
things is preferved : if there are rules obferved' in-
the produé‘tion of mos, trees, and the like: if the
several kinds of animal: are, in proportion to their
several degrees and ﬁations in the animal king- '
dom, furnilhd with faculties proper to a’ireﬂ and dc.
termin their actions; and when they aft accord-
ing to them, they may be laid to follow the law
of their nature: if they are placed and prooidedfor-
fuitably to their refpeélzive natures and wants 2, or
(which amounts to the fame thing) if their natures
are adapted to their circumﬂances “: if, lallly,‘
particular cafe: relating to rational beings are taken
care of in such a manner, as will at lalt agree belt
with reason.

in Mar. rebel. (a leaf's falling from a tree, a fpider‘s catching

Second! , If there are such laws and proviﬂons,
they can come originally from no other being, but
from Him who is the ﬂntbor of nature. For those
laws, which refult from the nature: of things, their
properties,.and the use of their faculties, and may
be said to be written upon the things themselves,
can be the laws of no other: nor can those things,
whofe very being depends upon God, will under
any condition repugnant to His will ; and therefore
can'be subject to no laws or difpoﬁtions, which
He would not have them be subject to; that is,
which are not His. Befide, there is no other being
capable of impoﬁng laws, or any fcheme of go-
vernment upon the world; becaqu there is no
other, who is not himselfpart of the world, and
whofe own exiﬂ‘ence doth not depend upon Him.

Third! , By the providence of God I mean His go-

Laﬂly, It is not impoﬂible, that there should be
[nob : on the contrary, we have juf’t reasons to be-
lieve there are. It would be an abfurd aﬂ‘ertion to
say, that any thing is impoﬁole to a being whofe na-
ture is inﬁnitely above our comprehenlion, if the
terms do not imply a eontmdiﬂion : but we may with
conﬁdence affert, that it isimpoﬁéle for any thing,
whofe exiﬂence ﬂows from such a being, ever to
grow so far'out of His reach, or be so emancipated
from under Him, that the manner of its exiﬁence
should not be regulated and determind by Him.

As to inanimate fab/lancer, we fee the cafe to be

perfevere to go the fame circuits over and over by
a certain law. Little bodies or particles, of the
fame kind, obferve continually the fame rule: of ‘
attracting, repelling, 556. 'When there are any
feeming variations in nature, they proceed only
from the diﬂ’eren’t circumf’cances and ' combina-g
ons of things, acting all the while under their an-
cient laws. We are so far acquainted with the law:
of gravitation and motion, that we are able to cal-
culate their eﬁ'eé’ts, and ferve ourfelves of them,
‘fupplying upon many occasions the defect of power
in ourfelves by mechanical powers, which never
fail to answer according to the eﬂabliybment. Brieﬂy,
'we fee it f0 far from being impoﬂible, that the in-
animate world should be governd bylaws, that all
the parts of it are obnoxious to law: by them in-
violalle.

As to vegetables, we fee alfo how they are deter-
mind by certain method: prefcribed them. Each
fort. is produced from its proper feed, has the
fame texture of ﬁbres ; is nouriihd by the fame kind
of juices out of the earth, digefted and prepared
by the fame kind of velTels, Es’e. Trees receive an-
nually their peculiar liveries, and bear their proper
fruits : ﬂowers are dreﬁ, each family, in the fame
colors, or diverlify their falhions after a certain
manner proper to the kind, and breathe the fame
elI'ences: and both these and all other kinds ol-
ferve their feafons, and feem to have their several
profeﬂions and trades appointed them, by which
they produce such food and manufactures (pardon
the rataelareﬂr), as may fatirﬁv tlie wants of ani-
mals. Being f0 very neceﬂ'ary, they, or at leaﬁ the

infenﬁble, and Mt made for fociety, they are ge-
nerally dpfmoNksat: being liable to a great con-
fumption both of them and their feeds, they yield
great quantities of these, in order to repair and mul-
tiply their race, 8:. So that here is evidently a re.
gulation, by which the several orders are prefervcd,
and the ends of them answered according to their
ﬁrﬂ cﬂablg'fbment too,

Then as to animab, there are lawr, which mat,
Miami. are common to them with inanimate be.
ings and vegetables, or at leaﬂ: such as refembIe "
their laws. The individuals of the several kinds of
those, as of these, have the fame (general) shape and
members, to be managed after the fame manner:
have the fame velTels replenilhd with the flame kinds
of ﬂuids, and furnifhd with the [Ema glands .for the
feparation and dif’cribution of such parts of them,
as a'nfwer the fame intentions in them all: are Iti-
mulated by the fame appetites and uneaﬁneﬂ‘es to
take in their food, continue their breed, s9%. And
whatever it is, that proceeds thus in a manner ['0

like to that of vegetables, according to ﬁx! me-
thods, and keeps in the fame general track as they
do, may be said to obferve and be under some like
rule or law, which either operates upon and limits
it ab extra, or was given it with its nature. But
there are, moreover, certain obligations refulting
from the several degrees of reason and fenfe, or
fenfe only, of which we cannot but be confcious in
ourfelves, and ,obferve some faint indications in.

as nothing lefs than laws, by which animals are to

organs and faculties adapted to their refpeftive cir-
cumi’cances and opportunities of finding their pro-
per food or prey, (do. even to the aﬁonilhment of
them who attend to the hil‘tory of nature. If men,
who feem to have more wants than any Other kind,
meet with difﬁculties in maintaining life, it is be-
cause they themselves, not contented with what is
decent and convenient only, have by their luxuries
and fcandalous negleél: of their reason made life

The world then being not left in a slate of con-

may fee, that in fat? there is ﬁccb a providence ‘.

The great difﬁculty is, how to account for that
providence, which is called particular ; or that,
which refpeéls (principally) particular men. For

the motions of living beings and free agents. For

the former, it cannot be impoﬁble for Him, upon

cm of free agents are at once all unlocked, and ex-
pofed to His View. For that knowledge is not in-
ﬁnite, which is limited to things peg/l or preyi'nt, or
which come to pafs neeeﬂhrz'ly.

. After all, what has been said is only a feeble at-
tempt to lhew, how far even we can ,go toward a
[conception of the manner, in which future things
may be known : but as we have no adequate idea
of an inﬁnite and perfeét Being, His powers, and

.pafs all our underﬂanding. It mui’t be something
different from and inﬁnitely tranfcending all the
modes of apprehending things, which we know
any thing of P.
We know matters of fact by the help of our
jénﬁs, the firength of memory, impreﬁions made
‘upon phanﬁ, or the report of Others (tho that in-
deed is comprehended under fen/2’s. For that,
which we know only by report, in proper speak-
‘ing we only know the report of, Or we have heard

either to be present, or once to have eeen : but is it
therefore impqﬂible, that there Ihould be any other
ways of knowing? This is so far from being true,
that, since God has no organs of fenfation, nor

we knew them in, if He doth not know them by
some other way, He cannot know them at all, even
tho they were present: and therefore there muft
be other ways, or at leaﬁ: another way of knowing
even matters of fact. And since the difﬁculty we
find in determining, whether future matters of
fact may be known, arifes chieﬂy from this, that
*we in reality conﬁder, withom minding it, whe-
ther they may be. known in our way of knowing ;
it vanifhes, when we recollect, that they are and
mull be known to God by some other way: and
- not only so, but this muf’t be some way, that is
perfect and worthy of Him. Future, or what to us
is future, may be as truly the object of Divine
knowledge, as pro/out is of ours : nor can we ‘1 tell,
what rcfpeft puff, pro/2w, to come, have to the Di-
vine mind, or wherein they differ. To deaf men
’ there is no such thing as found, to blind no such
thing as light or color: nor, when these things are
deﬁned and explaind to them in the heft manner,
which their circumi’tances admit, are they capable
of knowing bow they are apprehended. So here,
we cannot tell bow future things are known per-
haps, any more than deaf or blind peOple what
founds or colors are, and how they are perceived ;
but yet there may be a way of knowing too/2’, as
*well as there is of perceiving toe/e. As they want
a ﬁftb fenfe to perceive founds or colors, of which
they have no n0tion: f0 perhaps we may want a
ﬂxtla fenfe, or fame fucu! , of which future events
may be the proper objects. Nor have we any more

We can never conclude, that it is impqﬂzble for an
inﬁnitely perfeét Being to know what a free agent .
will ekoofe to do, till we can comprehend all the
powers of such a Being, and that is till we ourfelves
are inﬁnite and perfeél: ’. So far are we from being
able to pronounce with any ihewgof reason, that it
is impoﬁble there ihould be such knowledge in
God.
In the lalt place, this knowledge is not only not
limpoﬂilzle, but that which has been already proved
concerning the Deity and His perfection doth ne-
ceﬂ'arily infer, that nothing can be hid from Him.
-For if ignorance be an imperfeétion, the ignorance
of future acts and events mull: be 1'0: and then if
all imperfeétions are to be denied of Him, tbi:

There is indeed a commbn prejudice against: the
. prefeienee (as it is ufually called) of God; which
fuggel’ts, that, if God foreknows things, He fore-
knows them infalliny or certainly : and if so, then
they-are certain; and if certain, then they are no
longer matter of freedom. And thus prefcience and
:freedom are inconﬁl’tent. But fare the nature of a
thing is not cloanged by being known,or known
beforehand. For if it is known truly, it is known
to be what it is 3 and therefore is nor alterd by this.
The truth is, God fore‘fees, or rather fees the ac-
tions of free agents, because they will be; not that

'And since it has been proved (p. 137, r 38),
x that all corporeal motions proceed originally from
something tampered], it mul’r be as certain, that
there are incorporeal fubl’tanc’es, as that there is
motion. Beﬁde, how can we tell but that there
may be above us beings of greater powers, and.
more perfect intelleéts, and capable of mighty
things, which yet may have corporeal vehicles'as
we have, butﬁner and invg'ﬁole .? Nay, who knows
but that there may be even of these many orders,
tiling in dignity of nature, and amplitude of pow-

inlarging the capacities of matter, to aﬂim the

to be one of theﬁdi. rank, or that which is next

Now then, as we our/Elves. by the, use of our
powers do many times interpofe and alter the courfe
of things within our'fphere-from what it would be,

fpeé‘t of things within their fpheres, much larger
be fure, the leait of themall, than ours is : only
with this difference, that as their knowledge is
more extenﬁve, their intellet‘ls purer, their reason
better, they maybe much properer inltruments of
Divine providence with refpeét to us, than we can

To explain myself by a few inﬁances. When

is accompanied with uneqﬂnefr, and mui’t therefore

which it is used when ascribed to ourfelves. It
perhaps may not be amifs to call it Divine many,

we mean something, which, tho in our low way ‘
of speaking and by way of analogy we call it by

very diﬁ'erent. Or we may conﬁder it in general

that, which lies between the fame uncbangeaale

the fame thing, or Being, cannot refpeét' opptﬁte ‘
and cantradiﬁory characters in the fame manner ;

manner of addrefs, with all his care, are ﬁill inade-
quate, and belowothe Divine nature. In Ihort, by:
our applications we cannot pretend to produce any
alteration in the Deity, but by an alteration in
ourfelves we may alter the relation or refpeét lying
between him and us. .

As God is a pure, uncompounded Being, His
attributes of mercy, juﬂiee, 8zc. cannor be as we con-
ceive them: becaqu in him they are one. Perhaps
they may more properly be called together Divine
ﬂea/on : which, as it exerts itself upon this or that
occasion, is by us variou/ly denominated.

Here it mull: not be forgot, that merry or mercies
are many times taken for advantages or beneﬁts
V injoyd by us: and then they are properly ascribed
to God, from whom they proceed as the effeéls of
His beneﬁcence and providence. ‘

When we speak of the knowledge of God, we must:

. not mean, that He knows things in the way tbat we
do : that any intention or operation of His mind is
requiﬁte to produce it: that He apprehends things
by any impreﬂions made Upon Him: that He rea-
ibns by the help of ideas: or even that the know-
ledge, which in us is molt intuitive and immediate,
does in any degree come up to the mode in which
He knows things. We muﬁ: rather intend, in ge-
neral, that there is nothing, of which He is, or
can be ignorant : which has been said already 5 and
is, I am afraid, as much as we can fofeiy say.

defpife, if not lhun. I‘think there are two conﬁde-
rations, which may jul’tify a desire of form glory

formd any virtuous actions, or such as lit easy
upon their memories, it is a reasonable plea/are to
have the tel’timony of the world added to that of
their own confeiences, that they have done ‘well ’ :
and more than .that, if the reputation acquired by
any qualiﬁcation or aetion may produce a man any
real comfort or advantage (if it be only proteétion
from the infolencies and injul’tice of mankind; or
if it enables him to do by his authority more good
to others), to have this privilege mull: be a great
satisfaction, and what a  and good man may be
allowd, as he has Opportunity, to propofe,to. him-
self. But then he propofes it no farther than it may
be uﬂefal: and it can be no farther useful than he
want: it. So that, upon the whole, glory, praifc,
and the like, are either mere vanity, or only valu-
able in pr0portion to our dcfeﬁ: and want:. If then
those words are underflood according to the im-
port and value they have among men, how dares
any one think, that the Supreme being can pro-
pofe such a mean end to himself as our praifes .P ~

When we thank God for any deliverance or ina-
joyment, this mull: not be so underﬂood, as if He
could value himself upon our cermanioa: acknow-
ledgments, or wanted complements, or any return
from us. It is rather a profeﬂion of the fen/22 we
have of our wants and defeéts, of the beneﬁcence
of His nature, and the greatnefs or l'eafonablenefs
' of the mercies received: an eﬂ‘ort of a poor de-
pendent being, who desires to own things, as far
as he is able, to be what they are °; and efpecially
to beget in himself such a difpolition of mind, as
he ought to have towards his Almighty abeanaﬂor,

When we are said to be [wants of God, or to
farm Him, or do Him fwice, these phrafes are
not to be taken as when one man is said to be fer-

and affects us moi’c. Tho perhaps fame regard is
to be paid to the cuﬁoms of the place where we are 3
or of our own country to which we have been moﬂ:
used. Several nations may denote the fame thing
by different geiiures: and we may take these, as
we do their words; i. e. as having that ﬁgniﬁcation
‘ which they put upon them. ' .
Tho I have not hitherto mentiond it, there
ought to be alfo a public wow of the Deity. F or
a man may be conﬁderd as a member of a fodety,
and a: fuel: he ought- to worlhip God (if he has
the opportunity of doing it: if there are prOper
prayers used publicly, which he may refort to ;
and his health, 8c. permit). Or the foamy may
be conﬁderd as one body, that has common inte-o
reds and concerns, and a: fuel: is obliged to wor-
ihip the Deity, and offer one common prayer. Be-
. ﬁde, there are many, who know not of themselves,
bow to pray; perhaps cannot so much as read.
Thefe too must be taken a: they arr, and confeq
‘ quently some time and place appaintad, where they
may have suitable prayers red to them, and. be ‘
guided in their devotions. And further, toward
the keeping mankind in order, it is augﬂary there
Ihould be forne religion profeft, and even eﬂab-
lifhd 3 which cannot be without some public wor~
ihip. Andi were it not for that fenfe of virtue,
which is principally preferved (f0 far as it is pre-
ferved) by national form: and baht: of religion,
men would soon lofe it all, run wild, prey upon
one another, and do what clfe the word of favages
do. ‘ ‘
But how does this public worfhip, it may be
demanded, comport with that retreat and prian

recommended above? Anﬂ I spoke there of prayer
in general, to which those circumﬂances give a
great advantage: but then they are recommended
no farther, than they can be had, and the nature
of the prayer- admits of them. Excuse a fhort re-
ﬂexion here, which if it be not direélly for the
purpose, is net altogether foreign to it.. Tho he
who reads the form of public prayer reads it to
all at thefame time, that all may unite in one com-
men a&, which otherwife they could not do: yet
ﬁill every particular person, who minds the prayers
at all, has a Ie'parate perception of the words in
his mind, and tbera  others them, or the-fenfe
eontaind underthem, with more or lcfs. applica~
‘ tion and ardor. And since no man can be said to
pray any ﬁarther than he does ibis : and it cannot be
known to any body in the congregation belidc
himfeif, how far he doll: do it; his prayer is in
reality as privale, as if he was indode within a
thoufand walls. So that, though there are reasons
‘ for a public worlhip, yet I will venture to affirm,
that all true prayer is private : and the true feat of
it being in the wind, toward the interefting of
whoﬁ: powers all the circumﬂances of worlhip are
mainiy deﬁgned to.contribute, it may be said upon
that account to be always made in the molt re-
tired and undiﬁmzed of all retreats 2: nor can
more be laid in rel'peét of a worlhip, which by the
terms is in other relpeﬂs public. A man may be

and tbem capable of diﬂlm‘i‘ properties in 'tlaings (or

be any thing which B can call hair, it will be for
that reason not C’: : and o. «0. what is C’s will for

The life, link, Sec. of B are as much his, as B
is ling/if“. It is impoﬂible forC, or any other to
fee with the eyes of B: therefore they are eyes only
to B: and when they ceafe to be his 9w, they ceafe V
to be eye: at all. He then has the sole property in
them, it being impoﬂible in nature, that the eyes
of B should ever be the eyes of C.

Further, the labor of B cannot be the labOr ’of
C : because it is the application of the organs and
powers of B, not of C, to the effeéting of somen
thing ; and therefore the slalor is as much B’s, as
the limbs and faculties made use of arehis. '

~ ‘ Again, the mﬁﬂ or produce of the labor of B is
not the effect of the labor of C : and therefore this
eEeét or produce is B’s, not'C’s; as much B’s, as
the labor was B’s and not C’s ‘. Because, what'the
labor of B causes or produces, B produces by his
labor; or it is the product of B by his labor : that
is, it is B’s product, not C’s, or any other’s. And
if C should pretend ’to any property in that, which
B‘ only can truly calligis, he would act contrary to
truth ". '

Lal’cly, there may be wary things, which B may
truly call'bis in form: such fen/2, or upon forne such
account, as no other can: and to which C has no
more right than D, nor D than F, s9%. the property
of which will therefore be in B. Because C has no
more title than D, nor D than -F , 84'. and that, to
which every one bqﬂde: B has an equal title, no one
beﬁdes B can have my title to at all 1, their pre-'

'whilit his only remains. And in this cafe a ﬁnal]
matter, being oppofed to nothing, will be ﬂrong
enough to maintain the claim of B.

called his labor. So 1921‘ D‘Wl liJ‘s “ shangers devour his ~

the law: of batman nature, wrong, intolerable. Thofe
maxims may be efteemd the natural and 'true laws
of any particular fociety, which are molt proper to
procure the lumen: of it. Because bappineﬁ is the
end of fociety and laws : otherwife we might sup-j
pofe unbappinqﬁ to be propofed as the right end of
them; that is, unhappinels to be deﬁrable, con.
trary to nature and truth. And what is said of a
particular fociety is not lefs true, when applied to
the universal fociety of mankind. Now those things
are mo]! apt to produce happinefs, which make the
n2on men happy. And therefore tbofe maxims or
principles, which promote the general tranquilb'ty
and well being of mankind, if those words exprefs
the bappz'neﬁ of mankind, mutt be the true laws
of humanity, or the baﬁs of them : and all Inch
practices, asinterfere with these, mull: alfo inter-,-
fere with those. It is contradictory to say, that any
thing can be a general law of buman nature, which
tends only to favor the pleafures of some particulars
_ to the prejudice of the reﬂ, who partake of the
fame common nature; and efpecially if these plea—
fures are of the lower and orutal kind. As a million
of men are more than one; so in ﬁxing the public
laws of human nature, and what ought to be, or
not to be, they must: in reason be more regarded by
a million of time: : for here we conﬁder men only as
men.

It Will be easy now to ihew, that the tron/greﬂion
of these laws, conducing to the general good of
the world, is wrong and morally evil. For if man-

Other near relations. Here let me be underﬂood
to mean only those, between whom there is no fa-
mily relation (or between whom all family relation
is vanifhd). ’ '

In a Rate, where no law: of fociety make any
fubordination or diftinétion, men can only be con-
ﬁderd a: men, or only as individUals of the fame
finder, and equally Iharing in one common deﬁ-
‘ nition '. And since by virtue of this fame deﬁni-
tion B is the ﬁzme to C, that C is to B; B has no
more dominion over C than C reciprocally has over
'3 : that is, they are in this regard equal.

Perform! excellencies or defects can make no dif-
ference here: because, I . Who must: judge, on which
ﬁde the advantage lies? To say B, (or _D, or any

..body elfe) has a right to judge to the difadvan-
tage of C, is to ﬂoppoﬂ what is in question, aldomi-
nion over him; not to prove it. 2. Great natural
or acquired indowmentr may be privileges to them
who have them : but this does not deprive those,
.who have lefs, of their title to 'what they have ; or,
which is the fame, give any one, who has greater,
abilities, a right to take it, or the use of it from
them. If B has better eye: than C, it is well for
him: but it does not follow from this, that C
should not therefore fee for himself, “and use bis
eyes, as freely as B may bis. C’s eyes are accom-

his ; and each has the fole property in his own :
so their refpeé‘tive properties are equal. The cafe
would‘be parallel tothis, if B ih‘ould happen to
have better intelleﬂual faculties than C. And fur-
ther, if B ihould be ﬂronger'than C, he would not
yet for that reason have any right to be his lord.
For C’s lefs degree of strength is as much bis, as
B’s greater is his : therefore C has as much rig/at
‘ to his, and (which is the natural confequence) to
use his, as. B has to use his : that is, C has as much
right to rqﬂ/i, as B has to impofe or command, by
virtue of his strengthz and where’ the rig/at (tho
nor the power) of reliiting is equal to the right of
commanding, the right of commanding or domi-
nion is nothing. 3. Since firength and power are
moﬁ apt to pretend a title to dominion ‘, it may
be added further, that power and right, or a power
of doing any thing, and right to do it, are quite
different ideas: and therefore they may be feparat- '
ed, nor does one inferr the Other. Lax/My, if power,
4114‘ power, gives a right to dominion, it gives a
right to every tbing, that is obnoxious to it; and
then nOthing can be done that is wrong. (For no
body can do any thing which he has not the power
to do.) But this is not only contrary to what has
been proved in feet. I. but to aﬂért it would be to
advance a plain aoﬂtrdirjy or oontradiﬂion rather.

For then to oppofe the man who has this power, as
far as one can, or (which is the fame) as far as one
has the power to do it, would not be wrong: and
yet so it muf’the, if he has a right to dominion, or
to be not Oppofed. Moreover, that a man should
have a rigbt to any thing, merely because he has
the power to take it, is a doctrine indeed, which
may ferve a few tyrants, or some banditti and rogues,
but direétly oppofite to the peace and general good
of mankind; and therefore to be exploded, by
prop. III. It is alfo what the powerful themselves
could not allow, if they would but imagine them-
felves to be in the Rate of the weak and more 21:-
feneelefc ; and therefore unreasonable, by prop. IV ‘.

- VI. No man can bane a right to begin to interrupt
the bappz’ney} of emother. Because, in the ﬁrit place,
this fuppofes a dominion over him, and the moﬂ:
abfolute too that can be. In the next, for B to be-
gin to dif’turb the. peace and happinefs of C is
what B would think unreasonaéle, if he was in C’s
cafe. In the laﬂr, since it is fuppofed, that C has
never invaded the happinefs of B, nor taken any
thing from him, nor at all meddled with him, but
the wleole Iran/amen begins originally from B (for
all this is couchd in the word éegin), C can‘have
nothing that is B’s ; and therefore nothing, to

there are some things, which a man may truly call
bis; and let us for the present only fuppofe, that
there may be more. This premifed, -I proceed to

faculties and powers, which he has; or that the:
Author of nature has given them to him in vain.
For to what end has he them, if he may not a]?
them ?‘ And how may he use them, if not for his
own preﬁ'rvatian, when he is attackd, and like to
be abufcd, or perhaps deltroyd ?

All animals have a principle of fey—prq/ewation,

. which exerts itself many times with an uncontroul—
able impetuoiity. Nature is unzfirm in this, and
every where conftant to itself. Even inanimate bo-
dies, when they are acted upon, react. And one
may be fure, that no poﬁtion can have any foun-
dation in nature, or be conﬁftent with it and truth
(those infeparable companions), which turns upon
nature itself, and tends to it: deﬂruﬁion. .

Great part of the general happinefs of mankind
depends upon those means, by which the innocent.
may be faved from their cruel invaders: among-
which the opportunities they have of defending
themselves may be reckond the chief. Therefore
to debar men of the use of these opportunities,
and the right of defending themselves against: inju-
rious treatment and violence must be inconﬁﬂent
with the laws of nature by prop. III.

If a man has no right to defind himself and what
is his, he Can have no right to any tbing (the con-
trary to which has been already in part, and will
by and by be more amply proved); since that can-
not be his right, which he may not maintain to be
his right. A

If a man has no right to deﬁne! himself againft

ing proposition. And, more than that, it includes
a great abfurdity, to commence an injury, or to begin
the violence, being in nature more than only to
repel! it. He, who begins, is the true cause of all
that follows : and whatever falls upon him from
' the oppolition made by the defending party, is but
the effeét of his own a&: or, it is that violence,
of which he is the author, rcy‘leﬂed back upon him-
self. It is as when a man fpits at heaven, and the
fpittle falls back upon his own face.

Since he, who begins to violate the happinefs of
another, does what is wrong, he, who endeavours
to obviate or put a stop to that violence, does in

Lafﬂy, since every man is obliged to confult his
own happinefs, there can be no doubt but that he
not only may, but even ought to. defend it (feet. II.
prop. IX); in such a manner I mean, as does not
interfere with truth ", or his own deﬁgn of being
happy. He ought indeed not to act rel/My, or do
more than the end propofed requires : that is, he
ought by a prudent carriage and wife forecaft to
ihut up, if be can, the avenues by which he may be
invaded ; and when that cannot be done, to use ar-
guments and perfuaﬁves, or perhaps withdraw out
of the way of harm: but when these meafures are
ineffectual or impracticable, he mull: take such
other as he can, and confront force with force.
Otherwife he will fail'in his duty to himself, and
deny happinefs to be happinefs.

By the fame means, that a man may defend what
is his, he may certainly endeavour to recover what
has been by any kind of violence or villainy taken-
from him. For it has been lhewn already, that the
power to take any thing from another gives no
rig/l7! to it. The right then to that, which has been
taken from its owner againft his will, remains ﬁill
where it was: he may ﬁill truly call it bis : and if
it be lair, he may use it as bi: : which if he who
took, it away, or any other, .ihall hinder him from
doing, that man is even here the aggreﬂbr, and
the owner does but defend himself and what is his.
Beﬁdes, he, who uses any thing as his, when it is
bis, acts on tbeﬂde of truth: but that man, who
Oppofes him in this, and confequently aﬂ‘erts a
right to that, which is not his, acts contrary to
truth. The former therefore does what’icannot be
amifs : but what the latter does, is wrong by that
fundamental propofition, feet. I. prop. 1V.

Then further, if a man has ﬁill arigibt to what
is forceably or without his confent taken from
him, he muft have a right to the value of it. For
the thing is to him what it is in value to him: and
the right he has to it, may be conﬁderd as a right
to a thing. offueb a value. So that if the very thing
which was taken be defiroyd,or cannOt be retrieved,
the pmprietor neverthelefs retains his right to a
thing offaeb a value to him; and something mutt
be had in lieu of it : that is, he has a right to make
repréfals. Since every thing is to every man what
it is in value to him, things of the fame value to
any one may be reckond as to him the fame, and
to recover the equivalent the fame as to recover
the Ming izfelf: for otherwife it is not an equiva-

' lent.

lent. If the thing taken by way of reprifal should
be to the manrfrom whom it isgtaken, of greater
value than what he wrongfully took from the re-
coverer, he must: charge himself with that lofs. If
injuﬂice be done him, it is done by himself, the
other has no more than what he has a right to. To
which add, that as a man has a right to recover
what is his, or the equivalent, from an invader; so
he seems for the fame reasons to have a right to an
equivalent for the expenje he is at in recovering his
_ own, for the lofs of time and quiet, and for the
trouble, hazards, and danger: undergone : because
all these are the effects of the invaﬁon, and there-
fore to be added to the invader’s account.

the violation of truth) not to act confonantly to
this allegation is an omiﬁion that would be wrong.
What he does therefore is right. And then if he

3. .There are many things, which cannot be pof-

fell: without cultivation and the contrivance and
labor of the first poffeffor. This has generally been
the cafe of lands : and these are indeed more emi-

nently meant by the word poﬁﬂion's. Now to de-

prive a man of the fruit of bi: man cares and

fweat, and to enter upon it, as if it was the effect

of the intruder’s pains and travel, is a mof’c mani-

feﬁ: violation of truth. It is afferting in fact that

gives no right, interferes with prop. III. for it

mutt certainly be inconﬁf’tent with the peace and

bappz’mfc of mankind in general to be left in end-

lefs wars and ﬁruggles for‘that, which no man can

ever have any right to. And yet thus‘it mull be

if that doctrine was true: becaqu it has been de-

monﬁrated, that power confers no right; and there-

fore the ﬁeﬂ rigbt to many things can only accrue

from the ﬁrf’c poffeflion of them. 5. If B should

endeavour by force (or fraud) to eject C out of the

poITeIIion of any thing, which C injoys, and ob-

taind without expelling or diﬂurlz’ng any body, he

would certainly do that, which he himself would

judge unmet/enable, were he in C’s place. There-
fore he acls, as if that was not reason with refpeél: to

poiTeﬁions is the fame as to command him to leave
them, upon pain of fuﬁ‘ering for non-obedience.
But this is ufurping a dominion, which he has no
right to; and is contrary to prop. V. 7. No man
can expel] another out of his poﬂ‘eﬂion without
beginning to interrupt his h'appinefs : nor can any
one do this without contravening the truth con-
taind in prop. VI. .This therefore fecures the pot:-
feﬂ‘or in his poﬁ‘eﬂion for ever : that is, it confirms
his rigbt to the thing poﬂ'eit. Lo/ily, the ﬁrft pof-
feﬂor, of whom I have been speaking, has undoubt-
edly a right to defend bi: per/on, and such other
things as can only be bis, againi‘t the attempts of
any aggreﬂ'or (fee prop. 11.): therefore these no
one can have a right to violate. And therefore
again, if he cannot be forecany difpoﬂ‘eﬁ without
violence oﬂ'erd to they}, no one has any right to
difpoﬂ'efs him. But this mutt be the cafe, where
the poITeﬁbr does not quit his poﬂeﬂion willingly.
The right confequently mui’t remain folely in him,
unlefs he confents to quit it.

N. The ﬂiccwjor: of an invader, got into pof-
feﬂion wrongfully, may acquire a right in time 2,
‘ by the failure of such, as might claim under him
who had the right. For he, who happens to be in
pofiemon, when'all these are extinct, is in the place
of a prime occupant.

does C do any thing against truth, or that is wrong,
in taking them : because he treats them as being

'the act of that person, in whom is lodged the fole
power of diﬁvqﬁng of them. Thus C gets the title
innocently.

But in the cafe of eampaﬂ the reason, on which
this tranfaction (lands, is more evident liill. For
the contractors are fuppofed to receive each from
other the equivalent of that which they part with,
or at leall what is equivalent to them rte/joeﬁively,
or perhaps by each party pneferalle. Thus neither
of them 'is hurt: perhaps both advantaged. And
lo each of them treats the thing, which he receives
upon the innocent exchange, as being what it is:
better for him, and promOting his convenience and
happinefs. Indeed“ he, who receives the value of
any thing, and what he likes as well, in effect has
it stil}. His property is not diminifhd: the ﬁtuation
and matter ofit is only alterd. ‘

a To this may be reduced that title to things, which Tillb
mentions as conferred by some law (lege) ;_ and even those,
which a‘ccrue eorzditiene, “ by covenant, ” or ﬁrte, “ by lot.”

.to take any thing from another only because I'
think I. want it, or because I have power to take it,
and will have it, without any title to it, is the
highef’t pretence to dominion, and denial of our na-

diﬂurb the happinefs of Others: and lai’tly, it is to
deny there is any such thing as property, contrary to

Homer represents Ulyﬂe: 0d. 6. I 51,—2,—7,—8.) The tears
of men are in truth very different from the cries and ej ulations
of children. They are ﬁle»: firearm, and ﬂow from other
causes ; commonly some tender, or perhaps philofophical, re-
ﬂexion. It is easy to fee how hard hearts and dry eyes come.
to be falhionable. But for all that, it is certain the glandule:

fometimes, when they more coolly attend to things,
in those hardend and execrable man/ten of cruelty
themselves, who feem jul’t to retain only the leaﬂ:
tincture of humanity that can be. The Pbenean ty-
rant, who had never wept over any of those mur-
ders he had caused among his own citizens, wept
when he law a tragedy but acted in the theatre ‘ :
the reason was, his attention was caught here, and
he more obferved the fulferings of Hecaba 'and Au-
dromacbe, than ever he had those of the Pbemfaas;
and more impartially, being no otherwife concernd
in them but as a common fpeétator. Upon this oc-
caﬁon the principle of campaﬂion, implanted in hu.
:man nature, appeard, overcame his habits of cruel-
ty, broke through his petrifaction, and would lhew
that it could nor be totally eradicated. It is there-
fore according to nature to be affected with the
fuﬁ‘erings of other people: and the contrary is in-
‘lmman and unnatural.

Such are the circumﬂame: of mankind, that we
cannot (or but very few of us, God knows) make
. our way through this world without encountering
danger: and fuffering many evil: : and therefore
since it is for the good of such, as are so expofed
or actually fmarting under pain or trouble, to re-
ceive comfort and aﬂiftance from others, without'
which they mull commonly continue to be mifer‘a-
able, or perilh, it is for the common good and

they should compaﬁonatc and kelp each other ‘. To

do the contrary mutt therefore be contrary 'to mf-
ture and wrong by prop. III. And beﬁde, it is by
one’s behaviour and actions to affirm, that the cir-
cumf’tances of‘m'en in this world are not what they
are; or that peace, and health, and happinefs, and
the like, are not what tbqy are. ‘

Let a man fubﬂitute bimfelf into the room of
some poor creature dejected with invincible pover-
ty, diﬁracted with difﬁculties, or groaning under
the pangs of some difeafe, or the anguifh of some
hurt or wound, and without help abandond to want
and pain. In this diltrefs what reflexions can he
imagine be fboald have, if he found that every body
neglected him, no body so much as pitying him,
or vouchfaﬁng to take notice of his calamitous and
fad condition 9 It is certain, that what it would be
reasonable or unreasonable for others to do in re-
fpeél: of him, he mull: allow to be reasonable or un-
reasonable for him to do in refpeét of tbem, or
deny a manifel’t truth in prop. IV.

If unmercifulnefs, as before deﬁned, be wrong,
no time need to be fpent in proving that cruelty is .
so. For all that is culpable in unmercifulnefs, is
containd in cruelty, with addition: and aggrava-
tiom. Cruelty not only denies due regard to the
fuﬁ'erings of others, but waft: them; or perhaps
deling in them, and (which is .the moit infolent
and cruel of all cruelties) makes them a jag/l and
subject of raillery. If the one be a deﬁtt of huma-
nity, the other is diametrically oppoﬁte to it ‘. If

the one does no good, the other does much evil.
And no man, how cruel foever in reality he was,
has ever liked to be rec/toad a cruel man : such a
confeliion of guilt does nature extort; so univer-
fall y doth it rejeét, condemn, abhor this character.

unmerciful, or perhaps cruel.

length ﬂit]: into their places, according to their
several weights and capacities with refpeél: to the
common concern. And thus some form of a fa.
ciety mutt arife : men cannot fubﬁl’t orherwife.

But if it was poﬂible for a man to preferve life
by him/21f, or with his peril company about him:
yet no body can deny, that it would be inﬁnitely
better for him, and them, to live in a fociety,
where men are serviceable to themselves and their
neighbours at the fame time, by exchanging their
money, or goods, for such other things as they
want more; where they are capable of doing good
(fire: each for other in time of need; where they
have the proteﬂion of laws, and a public fecurity
againit cheats, robbers, alTaIiines, and all enemies
to property; where a common force or army is
ready to interpofe between them and foreign inva-
ders; and where they may injoy those difcowries
which have been made in arts and learning, may
improve their faculties by canvarfation and innocent
conﬂicts of reason, and (to speak out) may be
made men.

If, when we have the privilege of fociety and
laws, we can scarce preferve our own, or be fafe,
what a woful condition should we be in without
them; exPofed to the infults, rapines, and violence
of unjuﬂ: and mercilefs men, not having any fanc-
Iuaiy, any thing to take refuge in ? So again, if
_ notwithftanding the help' offriendr and those about
us, and such conveniencies as may be had in cities
and peopled places, we are forced to bear many
pains and melancholy hours, how irkfome would
life be, if in licknefs or other trouble there was no

body to adminiﬁer either remedy or con/clarion .?

_- Laﬂzly, fociety is what men generally deﬂre.
And the inueb company may be attended with
much vanity, and occalion many evils ‘, yet it is
certain, that abfolute and perpetual solitude has
something in it very irkfome and hideous 5. Thus
the focial life is natural to man; or, what his nag

ture and eircumﬁances require.

II. The end of faei'et} is the common welfare and
good of the people aﬂaciated; This is but the confe-
quence of what has been juit said. For becaqu
‘ men cannot fublil’t well, or not fa well, .feparately,
therefore they unite into greater bodies: that is,
the end of their uniting is their better fubﬁl’tence ;
and by how much their manner of living beeomes
better, by so much the more eﬁ'eétually is this end
answered. .

III. A/eciety, into wbieb men enter for this end,
fuppofes fame rule: or laws, according to wbieb tan
agree all to be governd, witb a power of altering or

of men met together without any rules, by which
they fubmit to be goverud, can be nothing but
an irregular multitude. Every one being still ﬁti

> VI. 11 man may part with fame of his natural
rights, and put hing/Elf under the government of laws,
and those, who in their severalﬁatiou: are, intru/t‘ed
with the execution of them, in order to gain the pro-
tettiou of them, and the privileges of a regular faciety.
Because bythis he doth but exchange one thing
for another, which he reckons equivalent, or indeed
fireﬁrahle by much : and this he may do Without
ﬂing againi’c any truth. For the liberties and nae.
aural rights, which he exchanges, are his am, and
therefore no other man’s property is denied by this :
nor is the nature of happinefs deniedto be what'it
is, since it is happinefs which he aims ,at in doing
this. On the contrary, he would rather oﬂ'end
againft truth, and deny happiuefs to be what it is,
if he did not do it; -efpecially seeing, that here his
own happinefs coincides with the general happinefs
and more convenient being of the kingdom or com-
monwealth, where his lot falls, or his choice deter-
mills  to live. ‘ . '

'280 The RELIGION of'NA'runa. Seét.VII.

If the quei’tion iihould be afked, wbot natural
rights a man may part with, or bowfor he may part
with them; the general anfw‘er, I think, may be
this. Some things are eﬂential to our being, and
some it is not in. our power to part with. As. to the
my}, he may depart from them ('0 far as it is con-
ﬁften‘t with the end, for which he does this 2 not
further, becaufc beyond that lies a contradiction.
A man cannot give away the natural right and pro—
perty he has in any thing, in order to pro/ewe or
retain that property : but he may confent to con—
tribute part of his eﬂate, in order to preferve the
re/i, when Otherwife it might all be loft -, to take
his [bore of danger in defence of his country, rather
than certainty periIh, be inﬂaved, or mind by the
conquci’t or- oppreﬁion of it; and the like.

VII, Mn may become members of o foeiey (i. e.
. do wire: is mentiond in the foregoing propqﬁtion) by
giving their eonfent, either explicitb', or implieitly.
That a man may subject himself to laws, we have
seen. If he does this, he muﬁ do it either in bi: own
per/on; or he mutt do it by some proxy, whom he
fubﬂitutes in his room to agree to public laws; or
his confent must be eo/leﬂed only from the confou-
mity of his carriage, his adhering to the fociety,
accepting the beneﬁts of its conﬂitution, and ac-
quiefcing in the ‘eftablifhd methods and what is
done by virtue of them.’ By the two ﬁrﬂ ways he
declares himself explicitly, and direﬁb' : not can he
after that behave himself as if he was no member
of the fociety, without acting as if he had not done
what he be: done. And this is the cafe not only of

tion of any government, but alfo of them, who
have in the said manners i given their confent to:
any fubfequent acts, by which they ownd, confirm-
ed, and came into what their anceﬁorshad done;
or who have by oz:th put themselves under obli-'
gations‘to the public. By the [a]! of the three-ways
mention’d a man’s confent .is given indeed impli.
citly, and lefs directly : but yet it is given, and he
becomes a party. For fuppofe him to be born in
some certain kingdom or commonwealth, but
never to have been party to any law, never to have
taken any aatb to the government, nor ever for-
mally to have ingaged himself‘by any other at}.
In this cafe he cannOt methinks- but have some low
and [ympatby for that place, which afforded him
the first air he drew; some gratitude towards that
conﬂitution, which protected his parents, while
they educated and provided for him -, some regard
to Othofe obligations, under which perhaps they
have laid him, and with which limitations as it
were they (or rather the Governor of the world by
them) conveyd to him his very life. ,.

" If he inherit: or takes any thing by the laws of
the place, to which he has no indefeaﬁble right in
nature,.or which, if he had a natural right to it, he
could not tell how to get, or'keep, without the aid
of laws and advantage of fociety ; then, when he
takes this inheritance, or whatever it is, with it he
takes and owns the law: which give it him.

,Indeed since the fecurizfy he has from the laws
of the country in refpeél: of his person, and rights,
whatever they either are, or may happen to be
hereafter, is the general equivalent for his fubmiﬁ

obliged in equity to pay the. '

Nay, laﬂly, his very continuing and ﬁttling in any
place Ihews, that either he like: the conﬁitution, or
likes it better than any other, or at Ieaﬂt thinks it
better in bi: circumﬂdnee: to conform to it than to
feel: any other: that is, he confents to be compre-

a word, to behave himself according to his [abor-

If then we fuppofe this aﬁettion or fympathy,
when it is permitted to ad: regularly and according
to nature, no reason intervening to exalt or abate
it, to Operate with a strength nearly proportionaole
to the quantity or degree of relation, computed as
above, we may perhaps nearly discern the degree:
of that obligation, which persons related ’lie under,
to aﬁiﬂ: each other, from this motive.

But there are many circumf’tances and incidents
inlife capable of affecting this obligation, and al-
tering the degrees of it. A man mutt weigh the
wants of biog/elf ‘ and his own family against'those of .
his relations: he mull; conﬁder their ﬁx, their age,
their aoilities and opportunities, how capaole they are,
of good ofﬁces, how they will take them, what use
they will make of them, and the like. He, who
deﬁgns to act agreeably to tratb, may find many
such things demanding his regard; some justly
moving him to compaﬂion, Others holding back
his hand. But however this may in general be
taken as evident, that next. after our parents and
own offspring W nature directs us to be helpful, in
the ﬁij/t place to brothers and ﬁlters, and then to
other relations according to their refpeétive dif-
tances in the genealogy of the family, preferaon

Prudence, the mural of virtues, is nothing but
choosing (after things - ‘. have been duly 'weighd)
and uﬁng the molt reasonable means to obtain
some end, that is reasonable. This is.therefore dz;
ra‘ﬂy the exercife of xeafon.

A .ﬂ'empemnce permits us to take meat and drink
nor only as phyﬁc for hunger and thirft, but alfo
as an innocent gordz’nl and fortiﬁer‘againﬁ; the evils
of life, or even fometimes, reason not refuﬁng that ’
liberty, merely as matter of plea/are. It only con-
ﬁnes us to' such kinds, quantities, and fen/ans, as may

yourfelf in your imagination beyond it (beyond it -
in time), and fuppofe it already done, and then fee
how it looks; always remembring, that a long re-
pentance is a difproportionate price for a [hart £72qu-
ment. Or, fancy it done by some otlaer man, and
'then view it in that ﬂeeulam: we are commonly
lharper-fighted in discerning the faults of others,
than of ourfelves °. And further, as to those vir-
rues, which are laid to conﬁi’t in the mean, it may
be fometimes fafer to incline a little more to one of
the extremes, than to the other : as, rather to ﬂin-
ginefs, than prodigality ; rather to inﬂexibility, and
even a degree of ill nature, than to dangerous com-

avirtuous man should in some refpeéts be unhappy,
yet ﬂill his virtue will make him left unhappy : for
at leaﬁ: he injoys inward tranquillity, and a brealt
confcious of no evil. And which kind of life I
pray ought one to prefer : that, which naturally
tends to bappineﬁ, tho it may be dif’curbed; ‘or
that, which uaturally tends to unbappimfr .? In

lb many heroes have triumphed over enemies, even
the greateft, deatb itﬁ’lf; that, which dil‘tinguilhes
nations, raifes empires, has been the grand theme
of almoﬁ all wits, attracts all eyes, opens all mouths,
and aﬂ'umes the name of virtue by ,Way of excel-
l’ence‘; that this Ihould be forgot!

To attone for this omifﬁon I will make this ap-
pendix to the foregoing brief account. If fortitude
be taken for natural courage (2'. e. firength, activi-
ty, plenty of fpirits, and a contempt of dangers re-
fulting from these), this is conflitution and the gift
of God w, not any virtue in us : because if it be our
virtue, it mul’t conﬁl’t in something, which we pro-
duce, ordo ourfelves ". The cafe is the fame with
that of ﬁne features and complexion, a large inhe-
ritance, or strong walls, which may indeed be great
advantages, but were never "called virtues 3’. To
have t/aefe is not virtue; bUt to uﬁ: tiaem rigbtgy, or
according to reason, if we have them. '

That this is juﬂly said, may Perhaps appear
from what is to be said on the ot/aerﬁde. It may
be a man’s misfortune, that he has not more ecu;
rage, a greater ﬂock of fpirits, firmer health, and

Y As that word is used here. For when it is used as in that
up. Luc. 'Apmi p‘e‘v caiy¢7©' 307(3):; “ virtue is the firength of the

them; but it never can be reckond a vice or fault
not to 21/63 what he has not : for oth‘erwife it might
be acrime not to be able to carry ten thoufand pound
weight, or outrun a cannon-ball.

Fortitude conﬁderd as a virtue conﬁﬁs in stand-
ing and endeavouring to overcome dangers and op-
poﬁtions, when they cannot be avoided without the
violation of red/en and truth. Here it is, that he,
who is endowd with natural bravery, a healthful
conﬁitution, good bones and muscles, ought to
15/2 them, and be thankful to the Doner : and he
who is nor so favord, mui’t yet do wlmt be can : if
he cannot conquer, he mutt endeavour to be pa;
tient and prudent. And thus he, who is naturally
timorous, or weak, or other'wife infirm, may have
as much, or more of the virtue of fortitude, than
the beta himself; who apprehends little, and feels
little, compared with the other, or poﬂibiy may find
pleafure in a fcene of dangerous action.

If a man can prevent, or e/mpe any peril or trou-
ble, falvé' veritete, he ought to do it: orberwife
he neither conﬁders [vim/Elf, nor tbem as being
what they are ; them not as unneceﬂ'aty, himself
not as capable of being Inert, by them 5 and so dafhes
againl’t truth on the worfe ﬁde 2. But where that
cannot be done, he mutt exert himself accordin
- to his eéiZitiet, whether great or little, and refer the
fuccefs to the Divine providence. This is the true
virtue of fortitude, which is nothing but endeavour-
ing firmly and honeﬁly to act astruth require: ; and

more is meant but a fubltance extended and impeo’
netrablc to other matter. And since,’ for this rea-
fon, it cannOt be neeeﬂ'ary for matter to think (be-
cause it may be matter without this property), it
cannot think as matter oan.

If it did, we should not only‘ continue to think
always, till the matter of which we conﬁlt is anni-
hilated, and so the alTertor of this doctrine would
stumble upon immortality unawares; but we mutt
alfo have thought alivays in time paﬂ, ever since that
matter was in being; nor could there be any the
leaﬂ: intermiﬂion of aﬂual winking :‘ which does
not appear to be our cafe.

If thinking, felﬂconfcioufnefs, Ede; were eﬂ'm:
tial to matter, every part of it mui’c have them:
and then no fyﬂem could have them. For a fyﬁem
of material parts would be a fyﬁem of things con-

and individuation of the several particles would
be as much retaind in their vicinity, as if they were

We nOt only mam ourfelves Upon reasons, which
we find in ourfelves, but upon reasons imparted
by words or writing from others, or perhaps merely
at their deflre or bare fuggef’t‘ion. In which cafe,
again, no body fare can imagine, that the word:
fpoken or written (the found in the air,_or the
ﬁrokes on the paper) can by any natural or me-
chanical qﬂcieme‘ cause the reader or hearer to move
'in any determinate manner (or at all). The reason,
requeft, or friendly admOnition, which is the true
motive, can make no imptéﬂion upon matter. It
mutt be some other kind of being, that appreg
bends the force and fenfe of. them. . \

Do not We fee in- co‘nverfation, how a pleafant
thing said makes people break out into laugbter,
a rude‘t-hing- into paﬂion, and so on? Thefe affec-
tions cannot be the play/ital qﬂ’eﬁs of the words
prkeh: because then they would have the fame
eﬁ‘eét, whether they were underﬂood, or not. And
this is further-demonﬁrable from hence, that tho
the word: do really'contain notbing, which is either
pleafant, or rude; or perhaps words are thought
to be fpoken, which are net fpoken; yet‘if they
are appreivmded' to do that, or the found to be
otherwife than ‘it was, the effect will be the [47726.
It is therefore the fen/e of the words, which is an
immaterial thing, that by paﬂing through the un-
derﬂanding and cauﬁng that, which is the subject of
the intellectual faculties, to inﬂuence the body,
produces these motion: in the fpirits, blood, muscles.

They, ' who can fancy, that matter may come to
live, think, and act fpontaneouﬂy, by being re-
duced to a certain magnitude, or having its parts‘
placed after a certain manner, or being inveﬁed

with such a ﬁgure, or excited by such a particular
motion: they, I say, would do well to difcover to
us that degree of ﬁnenefs, that alteration in the litu-
ation of its parts, ‘ C‘i’c. at which matter may begin.
to finditself alive and cogitative -, and which is the
critical ininnte, that introduces these important
pmperties. If they cannot do this, nor have their
eye upon any particular criﬂr, it is a ﬁgn they
have no good reason for what they say. For if
they have no reason to charge this change upon
any particular degree or diﬁ'erence, one more than
another, they have no reason to charge it upon
any degree or difference at all; and then they have.
no reason, by which they can prove that such a
change is. made at all. Beﬁdes all which, since,
magnitude, ﬁgure, motion are but accident: of
matter, not matter, and only the [alliance is truly
matter -, .and since the fab/lance of any one part of
matter does not differ from that of another, if any.
matter can be by nature cogitative, all mull be f0.
But this we have seen cannot. be. . ; ,

So then in concluﬁon, if there is any such thing
as matter tbat thin/e5, &c. this mutt be, a particular
privilege granted to it: that is, a faculty of think-
ing mul’t be. fuperadded to certain parts or, parcels
of it. Which, by the way, mull infer the exil’tence
of some Being able to confer'this faculty; who,
when the ineptnefs of matter has been well con-
ﬁderd, cannot appear to be lefs than omnipotent, or
God. But the truth is, matter seems not to be ca-
pable of such improvement, ‘of being made to
think. For since it is not the eﬂénce of matter,
it cannot be made to be [0 without making matter ,,
anotloer kind of fubﬂ'ance from what it is. Nor can it

cidents of matter; and in refpeét of what elfe can
any matter. be made to differ from other ‘matter ?
The accident: of matter are so far from being
made by my, power to produce cogitation, that
some even of tbem fhew it incapable of having a
faculty of thinking fuperadded. The very'di'vg'fia
win of 'it does this. For that which is made to
think mutt either be one part, or more parts j‘oind
together. "But we know no such thing as a part
of matter purely one (or indiviﬁble). It may‘in-
deed have pleade the Author of nature, that there
ihould be atoms, whofe parts are aﬂualéy indifcere
pible, and which may be the principle: of other
bodies : but still they conﬁit of parts, tho firmly
adhering together. And if the feat of» cogitation
be in more parts than one (whether they lie clofe
together, or are loose, or in a Rate of ﬂuidity, it is
the fame thing), how can it be avoided, but that
either there mutt be so many several minds, or

confequence, which has been mentiond, would re-
turn upon us again) 3 or elfe, that there must: be

rules of permam ; nor could I otherwife represent
it to myself : whereas now .I can form an idea of
it as it is in itﬁlf, and almoﬁ view all its bedne at
once, as it were incompaﬂing it with my mind.

I can within myself correfl the external appear-
ances and iinptellions of objeéts; and advance, up-
on the reports and hints received by my fenfes, to
form ideas of things that are not extant in matter.
By seeing a material circle I may learn to form the
idea of a circle, or ﬁgure generated by the revolué
"tion of a ray about its center: but then recolleﬁing
what 'I know of matter upon other occasions, I can
conclude there is no exaﬂ material circle. So that
I have an idea, which perhaps was raiﬁed from the
hints I received from without, but is not truly to‘
be found there. If I fee a tower at a great diﬂzance,
which according to the impreﬂions made upon my
material organs seems little and round, I do not
therefore conclude it to be eitber : there is some-
thing within, that reasons upon the circumﬁances
' of the appearance, and as it were commands my
fenfe, and correéts the impreﬂion : and this mull:
be something fuperior to matter, since a' material
jeul is no otherwife impreﬁible itself, but as mate—‘-
rial organs are. Inl’tances of this kind are endl‘efs.
(*v. p. 92, 93.) ' .

If we know any thing of matter, we know, that
by itself it is a lifelefs thing, inert, and paHive on-
” ly; and acts neceﬂarily (or rather is afted) accord-
ing to—the laws of motion and gravitation. This
paliivenel's seems to be (ﬂannel to it. And if we
know any thing of curfelves, we know, that we
are confcious of our own exiftence and acts (i. e.‘

A a 4. that

that we live) ; that we have a degree of ' freedom ;
that we can move ourfelves jpontaneou/ly; and in
ﬂuort, that we can, in many inﬁances, take off the
eﬁ'eél: of gravitation, and imprefs new motions up-
on our fpirits (or give them. new dire&ions), only
by a t‘bougbt. Therefore to make mere matter do
all this is to change the nature of it s to change
death into life, incapacity of thinking into c0gita_
tivity, necessity into liberty. And to say, that God
may ﬁtperadd a faculty of thinking, moving itself,
és’e. to matter, if by this be meant, that he may.
make matter to be the fuppo/itum of these faculties
(that fubi’tance, in which they inhere), is the fame
in effect as to say, that God may fuperadd a faculty
of tbinking to imagitativity, of acting freely to ne-
aﬁty, and so on. What fenfe is there in this? And
yet f0 it muﬁ be, while matter continues to be
matter.

That faculty of tbinking, so much talked of by
some as fuperadded to certain ﬂﬁem: of matter,
ﬁtly difpofed, by virtue of God’s omnipotence,
tho it be so called, must; in reality amount to the
fame thing as another fab/tame with the faculty of ‘

make up the idea of a human faul, which is indued ‘

paring, judging, making dedué‘tions and reasone
ing, willing, putting the body in motion, continu-.
ing the animal functions by its prefence, and giv-
ing life ; and therefore, wbate-per it is that is saper-
added, it mul’t be fametbz'ng which is indued With

mui’t not all be rather the faculties of some jab,
ﬂange 2, which, being (by their own conceﬂion)
fuperada'ed to matter, mutt be diﬂerent from it, I
do leave the unprejudiced to determin. "

If men would but seriously look into themselves,
I am persuaded the foul would not appear to them"
as a faculty of the body, or kind of appurtenant-e
to it 3 but rather as some fab/tame, properly placed
in it, n0t only to use it as an instrument, and act
by it, but alfo to govern it (or the parts of it; as
the tongue, hands, feet, 8c.) according to its own
reason. For I think it is plain enough, that the
mind, tho it acts under great limitations, doth'
however in many inﬁances govern the body droi-
trarily :‘ and it is monl’trous to fuppofe this gover-
nor to be nOthing but some ﬁt difpoﬂtion or am}

and that in the interim by means of this vehicle

VIII. The foul of man fulﬁll: after the diﬂolation
of bit body : or, i: immortal. For,

1. If it is immaterial, it is indifccrpiolc, and there-
fore incapable of being diﬂ‘olved or demolifhd, as
bodies are ‘. Such a being can only perilh. by an-
nibilation : that is, it ,will continue to fubﬁﬂ and
live, if some other being, able to do this, doth not
by a particular a& annibilate it. And if there is any
reason to believe, that at the death-of every man
there is always, such a particular annihilation, let
him that knows it produce it. Certainly to reduce
any jab/lance into notbing requires juﬂ: the fame
power as to convert notbing into something : and I
fancy they, who deny the immortality of the foul,
will be cautious how they admit any such power.

2. If the foul could be material ; that is, if there
could be any matter, that might be the subject of
those faculties of thinking, willing, Es’c. yet l’till,
since we cannot but be fenﬁble, that all these are
faculties of the [elf-fame tbing; and that all the fe-
‘ Vera] acts of the mind are acts of the jam Aching,
each of them individual and truly one: I say, since

it is f0, this matter mutt be f0 perfeﬂly united in
itself, so abfolutely one, as no matter knowable by
us can be. .And then the [raft that can be allowd
is that it should be truly folid, and not aﬂnaliy di-
viﬂble; that is, such as no natural gran/é could
deﬂroy. ‘

To introduce matter with a faculty of thinking,
or a flanking matter, is to introduce matter with a;
new and Oppolite property; and that is to intro-
duce a new jperie: of matter °, which will differ as
eﬂ'entially from therother common unthinking kind,
as any fpecies whatfoever doth from its oppolite in
[rain pmdicamentali, even as éody doth from jﬁritr
F or thinking and unthinking diEer as corporeal
and incorporeal. And if so, this thinking matter:
must: always continue to think, till either it is an-
nibilated, or there is -a tranfmntation of one fpecies-
into another: and to take refuge in either of these
eXpeétations is at leaft to expect omnipotence,
Ihould interpofe to help out a bad cause.

If any one should say, that God might by, vir-i,
tue of his omnip0tence fuperadd to certain parcels,
of. matter a fourth dimenﬂan, I ﬂ‘lOUld not perhaps-
difpute the Divine power: bUt I.might say, that
such matter, exif’ring under four dimenﬁons, ‘

3. The next argument fhall proceed- by-way of
'e'ﬂion and anﬁver.‘ Béeause a removal of the
principal objection again/9 any thing is a good ar-
‘ gument for it. Obj. It items as if thinking was not
eﬂ'en‘tial to the foul, but rathera capacity of thin/Em
ing under certain circumﬁances. For it doth not
think, when it lies coneeald in the primitive rudi-
ment of the man, in the womb, bperhapsin the be-
ginnings of infancy, in Heep, in a fwoon: and the
leafon of this seems to lie in thejcircumltances of the‘
body, which either is net fufﬁciently attended, and.
prepared ; or for a while implorys the ﬁairits wholly
in the digeﬂion of its aliment, and other ofﬁces in
the animal oeeonemy -, or by forne external attack,
or the working of some enemy got into it, has its
parts diforderd, and thepaﬁ'ages so pofi’eﬁ, that the
blood. land other ﬂuids can scarce break through; ‘
or after some such manner is preternaturally aﬂ'eé‘t-
ed. .And- therefore 'the‘question' to be resolved is
not, whether the fool is material or immatm’al;
and much lefs, whether it will be annibildtzd at
death“; bgt, whether that fouI (be it what it will),
which-ceafes to think, when the body is notﬁtly dif-

From hence then I gather, that the-sfoul pug/hm:

thinks no more, than if the bodywas def/iron ; and

pzzcz'ty be preferved for? Certainly not, that -it may
never be exerted. The Author, of nature doth nor.
life to aél: after timt manner. 80 that here isthis
dilemma to be oppofed to the objection. In ﬂeep
and fwoonings the foul doth either wink, ‘or not.
If it does, the objection has no foundation: and if
it dotb not, then all thatmwill follow, which I have
juft now said. '

nature made to inform some beefy, and that it can-

what we call death, mult' therefore reduCe it to’a

ﬂare of abfolute inﬂnﬁéilz'zy and rinauflfz'vity, which,

to it would be equal to non-exgﬁence. For that body,
which is so necelfary to it, may be‘forne ﬁne vehicle,
that dwells with it in the brain (according to that
motive/i: p. 361.) and goes off with it at death.
Neither the answers to the objection, nor the cafe
after death will be much alterd by such a fuppo/i-
tr'on. And since Iconfefs I fee no abfurdity init, I
will try to explain it a little further. We are fen-
lible of many material impreﬂions (impreﬁions
made upon us by material causes, or bodies) : that
there are such we are fure. Therefore there mull: be

it is immdiately and intimately united, and related

we alfo, that when any impreﬂien: are made upon '

the organs or parts .of the body, the effects of
them are carried by the nerve: up to their fountain,

and the place, where the foul in its vehicle is ', and

there they communicate their several motions (or
tremors to this material vebiele (or by their mo-
tions,'or tendency to motion, prefs upon) it ; s9 that
the foul, which inhabits it in a peculiar manner,
and is thoroughly poﬂ'eﬂ: of it, shall be apprehen-
ﬁve of these motions or preﬂ‘ures: and moreover,
that this vebz'ele so guarded and ineompaﬂed by the
body as it is, can be came at or moved by external
objects no other way, but by the mediation of the
nerves ; nor the jbul, by confequence, have any di-
reél: intelligence concerning them, or correfpon-

dence with them, any other way. And as we fup- .

pofe the foul to receive notices of things from with-
out in this manner, so let us fuppofe, on the other
ﬁde, that by moving its own velaiele it may pro-
duce motion in the contigUous ﬁirz'ts and newer,
and-f0 move the body: I mean, when nothing ren-
ders them unﬁt to be moved. ' Let us fuppofe ﬁJr-

which it is easy to underﬁand, and perhaps not
very difﬁcult to fuppofe. . On the contrary, by
many fymptoms it appears molt probable, that
that matter, to Which the .mind is immediately pre-
sent, and in which is its true fbekinab, is not the
whole grofs body, but some fubtile body, placed (as
I have said) in the region of the brain. For tbere
all the conveyances of fenﬁble [peeies confpire to
meet, and there in reﬂexion we find ourfelves:
when a limb is loﬁ, the foul, ’tis true, lofes an op-
portunity of receiving intelligence from or by it,
and of ufing it, but perceives no lofs in itself: and
tho the body, many parts of it at leaﬂ, are in a per-
petual ﬂux and continually altering, yet 1 know
that the fubftance, which thin/es within me new (or
rather, which is I), is,. notwithstanding all the
changes my body has undergone, the “very fame
which thought above ﬁfty years ago, and ever
since; when I playd in such a ﬁeld, went to such

remains. Now to answer the objection, and apply
all this to our purpose. Why do we n0t perceive
external objeé‘ts in our ﬂeep, or a fwoon .? Because
'the poﬂoge: are become impraé‘ticable, the windows
fhut, and the nerves, being obﬁruéted, or form:
how renderd for the time uselefs, can tranfmit no
information to it. Why however does it not rea-
fon and think about fometbitzg or other? Because,
all the mark: by which things are rememberd be-
ing for the present' choked up or difo'rderd, the re-
membrance of those objeﬂi, about which it is wont
to imploy itself, and even of the word: (or other
ﬁgns), in which it uses to reason, and to preferve
the deductions and concluﬁons it makes, is all fuf-
pended and 101% for the time; and so its tables bee
ing coverd, its books clofed, and its tools locked
“up, the requiﬁtes for reasoning are wanting, and
no fubjeé‘t offers itself, to exercife its thoughts, it
having yet had little or no opportunity to take
in big/oer objeﬂ: and more reﬁned matter for con.
templation. And to conclude, if it be demanded,
why anyone ihould imagin, that the foul may
think, perceive, aft after death, when it doth not
do this in ﬂeep, &c. the answer is; because those
izzeiofure: and impediments, which occafiond the
forementiond intermiﬁions, and those great limi-
' tations under which it labors at all times, will be
removed with its inlargement out of the body.
When it fhall in its proper vehicle be let go, and

jeéts : and why should not those impr’eﬂions, which
affected the nerves that moved and affected the ve-
hicle and foul in it, 4195222 the vehicle immediately,
' when theya-re immediately made upon it, without
the interpoﬁtion of the nerves ? The band, which
feels an object at the end of a ﬂaﬁ‘, may certainly
be allowd to feel the fame much better by imme-
diate cantaﬂ, without the i’tafi‘. Nay, why ihould
we n0t think, that it may admit of more objects
and the knowledge of more things, than it can
now ; since being expofed all round to the linﬂuenc
ces of them, it may be moved not onlyby viﬁble
objects juit at the extremities of the optic nerves,
by founds atithe ends of they auditwy, 8m. but be-
come as it were all eye to viﬁble objects, allege: to
audible, and so on .9 And why should we not think
this the rather, because then the foul may be alfo
perceptive of ﬁner impreﬂions and etbereal COntacts,
and confequently of. more kinds of objects, such as
we are now incapable' of knowing ? And then, this
being f0, why should we not prefage, that other
indowments, , as faculties of reasoning, communi-
Cating thoughts, and the like, will be propertienable
to such noble opportunities of knowledge P There
seems to be nothing in this account impaﬁéle; and
therefore nothing, but what may ee.

immortality of the foul, if there is any (but one)
good reason for it. ‘

But if we can in any tolerable manner (which in
our present circumi’tances is as much, as can be
eitpeé‘ted) account for the difﬁculties objeéted, and
those the greatq/Z:be1ong°ng to, this matter, and
show how it is poﬁble that they may conﬁft with
immortality, this will greatly cmoéorate the argu-
ments for it, if not be one its/2g)". This I hope is
done: or if I have not spoke directly tower) pm
of the objection, from .what has been done that
defect may eaﬁly be fupplied.

4. We may conclude the fouls of men robe im-t
mortal from the nature Qf God. For ifhe is (which
fore nobody doubts) a. Perfect being, He, as such,
can do nothing inconﬁl’tent with perfeﬁ or ugh:
reason. And then no facing, nor dream/lame of
any being, can come from  asits cause, which
it is not agreeable to ' fuck reafan should be: or
(which is the fame), He cannot but deal red/an-
abe with all His dependents. And then again, if
we are in the number of these, and the mortality
of the human foul does nor conﬁft with reason,
we may be fure it is immortal: as fure as we can
be of any thing by the use of our faculties; and
that is, as'fure as we can be of any thing. Whether
therefore that doth cargﬂﬂ with reason, or not, is to
be inQuired. '

To produce a being into a ﬂare .of clear bappi-
rug/s in any degree, can be no injury to it; or into
a sfate of mix: bappizze/i, provided the happinefs

' certainly overédlances the contrary, and the unhap-
py- or fquering part be not greater than what that
being would (baa/E: in order to obtain the happinefs,

or rather than lofe it. Nor, again, can any wrong
be done by producing a being fubjeﬂ to more mi-
lkry than happinefs, if that being has it in his own
power to avoid the mifery, or ['0 much of it, as
may leave the remainder of mifery not greater,
than what he would rather fuftain than mifs the.
proportion of happinefs. The only cafe then, by
which wrong can be done in the production of any
being, is, when it is necgﬂlzrily and irremedz’ably to
be mﬁrable, without any recompenfe, or balance
of that mifery ° : and this indeed is a cafe so grie-
vous, so utterly irreconcilable to all red/on, that the
heart of a reasoning. and conﬁdering man can
scarce bear the thought of it. So much every one
mul’t underftand of the nature of reason and jul’tice
as to allow these things for truths inconteftable.
Now then he, who fays the ﬂu] of man is mor-
tal, mutt say one of these two things :. either that
God is an unreasonable, unjul’t, cruel Being; or
that no man in refpeét of this life (which accord-
ing to him is all), has a greater share of mife'ry,
unavoidable, than of happinefs. To say the former
is to contradict that, which I prefume has been
proved beyond contradiétion. To which I may
add here, that this is to avow such an unworthy, im-

uncomfortable, dreadful paﬂ'ages : and a great part
of it, however things are palliated and gilded over,
is scarcer to be red by a good-natured man with-
out amazement, horror, tears. One can scarce look
into a news-paper, or out at his window, but hard—
Ihips and querings present themselves, in one
Ihape or other. Now among all tboﬁe millions, who
have fuﬂ’erd eminently, can it be imagind, that
there have not been multitudes, whofe griefs and

to efcape that litter drought, which they have
drunk? And then, howcan we acquit the juﬂiee'

, fore indeed, when it is said that virtue naturally
tends to make men happy even here, the meaning
only is, that it tends to make men happy in pro-
portion to their circumﬁances ; and vice does the
contrary. It is naturally productive of that part of
happinefs, which is in our own power, and depends
upon our/Elves; makes . men more truly happy, '

an expeﬂation, can scarce be denied. The hiﬁories
of mankind, their deiﬁcations, rites, ﬁories of ap-
iparitions, the frethent mention of' a tales, with
rewards and punilhments hereafter, (sic. all tefti-
'fy, that even the Heathen world believed, that the
foul: of men fumived their bodies. Their ignorance
indeed of the feats and circuml’tances of the de-
parted has wgot many error: and fapeﬂlitiom ;‘ and
these have been .multiplied by licentious poet: and
idle ‘vi/ionairs‘: but this, being no more than what
is ufual in the like cafes, ought to be no prejudice

against: the fundamental opinion it/elf. _
Cicero 9, tho he owns there were diﬂ'erent Opini-
ons among the Greek philosophers about this mat-
ter; that, quod literi: extet', Pbereeyde: Syru: primam
dixit, animo: borizinum eﬂe ﬂmpiternosg that Pytba-
gora: and his fchool confirmed this opinion; that
Plato was the man, who brought a reason for it,
s3%. yet tells us plainly, naturam ipfam de immor-
talitate animorum tacitam judieare; that nefeio qua-
modo 'inbaret in mentiau: qua/i faealorum qaoddam
augurium; that permanere animo: arbitramur eon-
fen/it nationum omnium; and more to this purpose.
Now if this confent was only the efl‘eét of some
tradition, handed from parents to their children ;
yet since we meet with it in all the quarter: of the
world (where there is my civility or 'fenfe), and in
all ages, it seems to be eowal to mankind itself,
and born with it. And this is fuﬂicient to give a
great autbority to this Opinion of the foul’s immor-
Itality. But this is not all. For it'is fupported by

~ This argument grows [hanger in the apprehen-

spiritual and above this world. To such a one there
mull be a strong expectation indeed, and the argu-
ment built upon it muﬁA&,prOWMOnable. For
can he be indowd with such capacities, and have
'as it were onertnres of immortality ‘ made him, if

Can a perfect Being have so little regard to one.

Are such meditation: and reﬂexions as these well
founded, or not? If they are, it muft be reasonable
to think, that God will fatisfy a reafenaale expat-
tatien. ' I .

There are other argument: for the immortality
of the foul, two of which I will leave with you,‘
to be ,at your leifure ponderd well. The one is,
that, if the foul: of men are mortal (extinguilhd
at death), the cafe of brute: is by much preferable
to that of men. The plea/are: of brutes, tho but

fenfual, are more fineere, being palled afdiminiﬂld
by no diverting conﬁderation: they go wbalb' into
them 3 and when they have them not, they shem '
iefs to want them, not thinking of them. Their
fafering: are attended with no reﬂexion 1', but are
such as they are said to be p. 57. obf. 8. They
are void of cams; are under , no apprehenﬁon foi-
families and pofierity ; never fatigue themﬁlves

them, having never [0 mark a: known that they

The other is, that the foul is a prszch [(79.-

rational faculties ; . but alfo in the greater or lefs in-
ﬂuence of these upon their aé‘tions, and by confe-
quence in their diﬁ‘erentdegrees of virtue, or nice.
For a man is accounted a red/enable man, when he
reasons rightly, and follows his reason : in which
expreﬂion . virtue muft be included, being (as
p. 3 36, s9" 4!.) nothing but the praﬂiee of reason;
and truth. i I '

That men are reasonable, or the contrary, in.
dzferent degree: is plain. Some reason well upon
fame subjects, but in refpeét of ot/oers, to which
they have not been accuﬂomd, are dim and con-
fused: or they are partial‘to their vices and paf-
ﬁons, their old impreliions and parties; and so
their reason is not general, nor has its due extent, ‘
'or inﬂuence. Others, whofe reason is uncultivated
and weak, tho they have virtuous inclinations,
many times fall into fupeﬂiitz’on and obfurdz'tieeg
milled by authorities, and over-awed by old, or
formal modes of speaking, and grave non-ﬁnk.
Many, if not the molt, feem to have scarce any
notion of reasonuor virtue at all, but a8: fortuitouf-
.ly, or as they fee other folks aft; moved either
.by bodily prOpenlions, or by example. Some few
there are, who endeavour to improve their under—
‘iﬁandings, to difcover what is agreeable to reason,
and to ﬁx their opinions; and condué‘t their live:
‘accordingly. And in all these [were] kind: there
, are various degrees of elevation in knowledge and
'virtue, and of immerlion in vice and ignorance,
and new differences ariﬁng endleﬂy. —All this is
viﬁble. *

virtues and vices, are compared and balanced. I
say, taken together : because no reason. can be af-

for the pains and mifchiefs and troubles, which he
brings upon bim/elf by his vices, as the natural con-
ferquences of them; nor, on the other ﬁde, why
any deductions should be made from the future'

Now by the same <em>rule</em>, by which punishments are justly proportioned, crimes must be distinguished amongst themselves; and therefore much more, crimes from no-crimes, and crimes from good actions. So that it is at bottom a <em>rule</em> which can do this, that is required.</li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Formula quædam constituenda est: quam si sequemur in comparatione rerum, ab officio nunquam recedemus</i> (Cicero). “There ought to be some rule established: which if we follow in comparing things with each other, we shall never fall short of our duty” (Cicero).</li>
<li><i xml:lang="grc">Πώς οίόν τε ἀτέκμαρτα εῖναι καἰ ἀνεύρετα τὰ ἀναγκαἰότατα ἐν ἀνθρώποις; Ἔςιν οὖν [κανών τις]</i> (Arrian).</i> “How is it possible that those things which are necessary for men (to know or to do) should be such, as they can have no certainty of knowing or finding out? There must then be [some rule].”</li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Ubi virtus, si nihil situm est in pisis nobis?</i> “Where is virtue then, if there be nothing within our own power?” (Cicero).
<li><i xml:lang="he" dir="rtl">הוא עמוד התורה והמצוה …רשות לכל אדם נתונה אם רצה להטות עצמו לדרך טובה</i> “There is a power given to every man, if he be but willing to incline himself to the way that is good—This is the support of the law and the commandments.” (Maimonides). <i xml:lang="he" dir="rtl">הרשות היא הבחירה</i> “This power is what we call free will," <i><abbr>Nahh.</abbr> <abbr>ab.</abbr></i> <!-- double-check the Hebrew on that last quote; also, what the heck is a Nahh Ab?--></li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Lacrymæ pondera vocis habent.</i> “Tears have the force of words." Ovid.</li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Oculi, supercilia, frons, vultus denique totus, qui sermo qui dam tacitus mentis est, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></i> “The eyes, the eyebrows, and indeed the whole countenance are a kind of tacit speech of the mind, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>” (Cicero). <i xml:lang="la">Nutu signisque loquuntur.</i> “They (Piramus and Thisbe) speak to each other by nods and signs.&rdquo; (Ovid). <i xml:lang="la">Est actio quasi sermo corporis.</i> “Every action is a sort of a speech of the body.” (Cicero, and often repeated by him.)</li>
<li><i xml:lang="he" dir="rtl">איש אוז מולל ברגליו</i><!-- double-check --> “A wicked man speaks by his feet.” (A Hebrew Proverb.)</li>
<li><i xml:lang="grc">Τὸν κατὰ τῆς κινήσεως λόγον σιωπῶν περιεπάτησεν</i> “Without saying anything against the argument about motion, he got up and walked about.” (Sextus Empiricus) So Menedemus reproved luxury by eating only olives (Diogenes Laertes). And others are mentiond by Plutarch, who <i xml:lang="grc">ἄνευ φωνῆς ἃ δεῖ φράζειν</i>, did declare “what they had to say without making use of words.”</li>
<li>Macrobius</li>
<li>Where we find <i xml:lang="grc">φίλοι τε φίλοις καὶ πολῖται πολίταις&hellip; ἐς χεῖρας ἀλλήλοις ἐλθόντες</i> “that friends and fellow-citizens fell into each other’s hands.&rdquo; (Thucydides)</li>
