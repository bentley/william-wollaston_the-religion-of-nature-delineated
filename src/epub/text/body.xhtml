<i>The Religion of Nature Delineated</i> being a Book in great esteem with her late majesty Queen Caroline, she was pleased to command me to translate the Notes
into English for her own use: And there being a Demand for a new Edition, it was thought proper to publish this translation, as these Notes are illustrations and Confirmations of the Sentiments of the learned Author; and therefore I have consented to the publishing of them,

The Religion of Nature Delineated

To <abbr class="name">A.F.</abbr>, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>
<p>
I was much surprised, sir, when (fome time ago) you so importunately desired my thoughts upon these questions,
</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there really any such thing as <em>natural religion</em>, properly and truly so called?</li>
<li>If there is, what is it?</li>
<li>How may a man qualify himself, so as to be able to judge, for himself, of the other religions professed in the world, to settle his own opinions in disputable matters; and then to enjoy tranquility of mind, neither disturbing others, nor being disturbed at what passes among them?
</ol>
<p>
With what view you did this; Whether in expectation of some little degree of satisfaction; or merely to try my abilities; or (which I rather think) out of kindness to amuse me at a time, when I wanted something to divert melancholy reflections, I shall not venture to guess. I shall only say, that could I have foreseen in due time, that such a task was to be imposed upon me, I might have been better prepared for it. I might have marked what was suitable to my purpose in those books, which I have read, but shall scarce ever return to read any more: many more I might have read too, which, not wanting them for my own conviction, I have neglected, and now have neither leisure nor patience to peruse: I might have noted what the various occurrences and cases, that happen in life, suggested: and, in general, I might have placed more of my time on such parts of learning, as would have been directly serviceable to me the present occasion.
</p><p>
However, as I have not spent my days without thinking and reflecting seriously within myself upon the articles and duties of natural religion, and they are <em>my thoughts</em> which you require, I have attempted, by recollecting old meditations, and consulting a few scattered papers, in which I had formerly for my own use set down some of them (briefly, and almost solecistically), to give an answer to the two first of your questions, together: tho’ I must own, not without trouble in adjusting and compacting loose sentiments, filling up vacuities, and bringing the chaos into the shape of something like a system.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding what I have said, in a treatise of natural religion, a subject so beaten and exhausted in all its parts, by all degrees of writers, in which many notions will inevitably occur that are no one’s property, and so many things require to be proved, which can scarce be proved by any other but the old arguments (or not so well), you must not expect to find <em>much</em> that is new. Yet <em>something</em> perhaps you may. That, which is advanced in the following papers, concerning the nature of moral good and evil, and is the prevailing thought that runs through them all, I never met with anywhere. And even as to those matters, in which I have been prevented by others, and which perhaps may be common, you have them, not as I took them from anybody, but as they used to appear to me in my walks and solitudes. So that they are indeed <em>my thoughts</em>, such as have been <em>long mine</em>, which I send you; without any regard to what others have, or have not said: as I persuade myself you will easily perceive. It is not hard to discern, whether a work of this kind be all of a piece; and to distinguish the genuine hand of an author from the false wares and patch-work of a plagiary. Though after all, it would be madness in a man to go out of his right way, only because it has been frequented by others, or perhaps is the high road.
</p><p>
Sensible how unfinished this performance is, I call it only a delineation, or rude draft. Where I am defective, or trip, I hope you will excuse a friend, who has now passed the threshold of old age; and is, upon that and other accounts, not able to bear much study or application. And thus I commit to your candor what follows: which, for the sake of order and perspicuity, I have divided into sections, and propositions.
</p>
<h2>Section I. Of Moral Good and Evil.</h2>
<p>
The foundation of religion lies in that difference between the acts of men, which distinguishes them into good, evil, indifferent. For if there is such a difference, there must be religion; &amp; <i xml:lang="la">contra</i>. Upon this account it is that such a long and laborious inquiry has been made after some general idea<a>, or some rule<a>, by comparing the foresaid acts with which it might appear, to which kind they respectively belong<a>. And though men have not yet agreed upon any one, yet one certainly there must be<a>. That, which I am going to propose, has always seemed to me not only evidently true, but withal so obvious and plain, that perhaps for this very reason it has not merited the notice of authors: and the use and application of it is so easy, that if things are but fairly permitted to speak for themselves their own natural language, they will, with a moderate attention, be found <em>themselves</em> to proclaim their own rectitude or obliquity; that is, whether they are disagreeable to it, or not. I shall endeavor by degrees to explain my meaning.
</p><p>
<b>I. That act, which may be denominated morally good or evil, must be the act of a being capable of distinguishing, choosing, and acting for himself</b>:<a> or more briefly, <b>of an intelligent and free agent</b>. (Because in proper speaking no act at all can be ascribed to that, which is not indued with these capacities. For that, which cannot distinguish, cannot choose: and that, which has not the opportunity, or liberty of choosing for itself, and acting accordingly, from an internal principle, acts, if it acts at all, under a necessity incumbent <i xml:lang="la">ab extra</i>. But that, which acts thus, is in reality only <em>an instrument</em> in the hand of something which imposes the necessity; and can-not properly be said <em>to act</em>, but <em>to be acted</em>. The act must be the act of an agent: therefore not of his instrument.
</p><p>
A being under the above-mentioned inabilities is, as to the morality of its acts, in the state of inert and passive matter, and can be but a <em>machine</em>: to which no language or philosophy ever ascribed <i xml:lang="grc">ἤθη</i> or <i xml:lang="la">mores</i>.
</p><p>
<b>II. Those propositions are true, which express things as they are: or, truth is the conformity of those words or signs, by which things are expressed, to the things themselves.</b> Definition.
</p><p>
<b>III. A true proposition may he denied, or things may be denied to be what they are, by deeds, as well as by express words or another proposition.</b> It is certain there is a meaning in many acts and gestures. Everybody understands weeping,<a> laughing, shrugs, frowns, <abbr>etc.</abbr> these are a sort of universal language. Applications are many times made, and a kind of dialogue maintained only by casts of the eye and motions of the adjacent muscles.<a> And we read of feet, that speak;<a> of a philosopher, who answered an argument by only getting up and walking;<a> and of one, who pretended to express the same sentence as many ways by gesticulation, as even Cicero himself could by all his <i xml:lang="la">copia</i> of words and eloquence.<a> But these instances do not come up to my meaning. There are many acts of other kinds, such as constitute the character of a man’s conduct in life, which have <em>in nature</em>, and would be taken by any indifferent judge <em>to have a signification</em>, and <em>to imply some proposition</em>, as plainly to be understood as if it was declared in words: and therefore if what such acts declare to be, is not, they must contradict truth, as much as any false proposition or assertion can.
</p><p>
If a body of soldiers, seeing another body approach, should fire upon them, would not this action declare that they were enemies; and if they were not enemies, would not this military language declare what was false? No, perhaps it may be said; this can only be called a mistake, like that which happend to the Athenians in the attack of Epipolæ,<a> or to the Carthaginians in their last encampment against Agathocles in Africa.<a> Suppose then, instead of this firing, some officer to have <em>said</em> they were enemies, when indeed they were friends: would nor that sentence affirming them to be enemies be false, notwithstanding he who spoke it was mistaken? The truth or falsehood of this affirmation does not depend upon the affirmer’s knowledge or ignorance: because there is a certain sense affixed to the words, which must either agree or disagree to that, concerning which the affirmation is made. The thing is the very same still, if into the place of <em>words</em> be substituted <em>actions</em>. The salute here was in nature the salute of an enemy, but should have been the salute of a friend: therefore it implied a falsity. Any spectator would have understood this action as I do; for a declaration, that the other were enemies. Now what is to be understood, has a meaning: and what has a meaning, may be either true or false: which is as much as can be said of any verbal sentence.
</p><p>
When Popilius Lænas solicited to have Cicero proscribed, and that he might find him out and be his executioner,<a> would not his carriage have sufficiently signified to any one, who was ignorant of the case, that Tully either was some very bad man, and deserved capital punishment; or had some way grievously injured this man; or at least had not saved his life, nor had as much reason to expect his service and good offices upon occasion, as he ever had to expect Tully’s? And all these things being false, were not his behavior and actions expressive of that which was false, or contradictions to truth? It is certain he <em>acted as if</em> those things had been true, which were not true, and as if those had not been true which were true (in this consisted the fault of his ingratitude): and if he in words had <em>said</em> they were true or not true, he had done no more than <em>talk as if</em> they were so: why then should not to act as if they were true or not true, when they were otherwise, contradict truth as much as to say they were so, when they were not so?<a>
</p><p>
A pertinacious objector may perhaps still say, it is the business of soldiers to defend themselves and their country from enemies, and to annoy them as opportunity permits; and self-preservation requires all men not only barely to defend themselves against aggressors, but many times also to prosecute such, and only such, as are wicked and dangerous: therefore it is natural to conclude, that they are enemies against whom we see soldiers defending themselves, and those men wicked and dangerous, whom we see prosecuted with zeal and ardor. Not that those acts of defending and profecuting speak or signify so much: but conjectures are raised upon the common sense, which mankind has of such proceedings. Answer: If it be natural to conclude anything from them, do they not naturally convey the notice of something to be concluded? And what is conveying the notice of anything but notifying or signifying that thing? And then again, if this signification is natural and founded in the <em>common</em> principles and sense of mankind, is not this more than to have a meaning which results only from the use of some <em>particular</em> place or country, as that of language does?
</p><p id="anchor1">
 If A should enter into a compact with B, by which he promises and engages never to do some certain thing, and after this he does that thing: in this case it must be granted, that his act interferes with his promise, and is contrary to it. Now it cannot interfere with his promise, but it must also interfere with the truth of that <em>proposition</em>, which says there was such a promise made, or that there is such a compact subsisting. If this proposition be true, <i>A made such a certain agreement with B</i>, it would be denied by this, <i>A never made any agreement with B</i>. Why? Because the truth of this latter is inconsistent with the agreement asserted in the former. The formality of the denial, or that, which makes it to be a denial, is this inconsistency. If then the behavior of A be inconsistent with the agreement mentioned in the former proposition, that proposition is as much denied by A’s behavior, as it can be by the latter, or any other proposition. Or thus, If one proposition imports or contains that which is contrary to what is contained in another, it is said to contradict this other, and denies the existence of what is contained in it. Just so if one act imports that which is contrary to the import of another, it contradicts this other, and denies its existence. In a word, if A by his actions denies the engagements, to which he has subjected himself, his actions deny them; just as we say, Ptolemy by his writings denies the motion of the earth, or his writings deny it.<a>
</p><p>
 When the question was asked, <i>Whose sheep are these?</i> the answer was, <i>Ægon’s: for he committed them to my care</i><a> (he uses and disposes of them as his). By this act Damœtas understood them to be his; and if they had not been his, but Alphondas’s or Melibœus’s, Ægon, by an act very intelligible to Damœtas, had expressed what was not true. What is said here is the stronger, because he, who has the use and disposal of anything, has all that he can have of it; and, vice versa, he who has the all (or property) of anything, must have all the use and disposal of it. So that a man cannot more fully proclaim any thing to be his, than by using it, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> But of this something more hereafter.
</p><p>
In the Jewish history we read, that when Abimelech saw Isaac sporting<a> with Rebecca, and taking conjugal liberties,<a> he presently knew her to be Isaac’s wife; and if she had not been his wife, the case had been as in the preceding instance. If it be objected, that she might have been his mistress or a harlot; I answer, that so she might have been, though Isaac had told him by words that she was his wife. And it is sufficient for my purpose, and to make acts capable of contradicting truth, if they may be allowed <em>to express things as plainly and determinately as words can</em>. Certainly Abimelech gave greater credit to that information which passed through his eye, than to that which he received by the ear;<a> and to what Isaac did, than to what he said. For Isaac had told him, that she was not his wife, but his sister.<a>
</p><p>
A certain author<a> writes to this purpose, “If a soldier, who had taken the oath to Cæsar, should run over to the enemy, and serve him against Cæsar, and after that be taken; would he not be punished as a deserter, and a perjured villain? And if he should plead for himself, that he never denied Cæsar; would it not be answered, That with his tongue he did not deny him, but with his actions (or by facts) he did?” And in another place, “Let us, says he, suppose some tyrant command a Christian to burn incense to Jupiter, without adding anything of a verbal abnegation of Christ: if the Christian should do this, would it not be manifest to all, that by that by that very act he denied him;” (and I may add, consequently denied those propositions which affirm him to be the Christ, a teacher of true religion, and the like<a>)?
</p><p>
When a man lives, as if he had the estate which he has not, or was in other regards (all fairly cast up) what he is not, what judgment is to be passed upon him? Does not his whole conduct breathe untruth? May we not say (if the propriety of language permits), that he lives a lie?<a>
</p><p>
In common speech we say some actions are insignificant, which would not be sense, if there were not some that are significant, that have a tendency and meaning. And this is as much as can be said of articulate sounds, that they are either significant or insignificant.</a>
</p><p>
It may not be improperly observed by the way, that the significance here attributed to men’s acts, proceeds not always from nature, but sometimes from custom and agreement among people,<a> as that of words and sounds mostly does. Acts of the latter kind may in different times and places have different, or even contrary significations. The generality of Christians, when they pray, take off their hats: the Jews, when they pray<a> or say any of their Berakoth, put them on. The same thing which among Christians denotes reverence, imports irreverence among the Jews. The reason is, because covering the head with a hat (if it has no influence upon one’s health) is in itself an indifferent thing, and people by usage or consent may make it interpretable either way. Such acts seem to be adopted into their language, and may be reckoned part of it. But acts of the former kind, such as I chiefly here intend, have an unalterable signification, and can by no agreement or force ever be made to express the contrary to it. Ægon’s treating the flock, and disposing of it as if it was his, can by no torture be brought to signify that it was not his. From whence it appears, that facts express more strongly, even than words themselves;<a> or to contradict any proposition by facts is a fuller and more effectual contradiction, than can possibly be made by words only.<a> Words are but arbitrary signs<a> of our ideas, or indications of our thoughts (that word, which in one language denotes <i>poverty</i>,<a> in another denotes <i>riches</i><a>): but <em>facts</em> may be taken as the effects of them, or rather as the <em>thoughts themselves produced into act</em>; as the very conceptions of the mind brought forth, and grown to maturity; and therefore as the most natural and express representations of them. And, beside this, they bear certain respects to things, which are not arbitrary, but as determinate and immutable as any ratio’s are in mathematics. For the facts and the things they respect are <em>just what they are</em>, as much as any two given quantities are; and therefore the respects interceding between those must be as fixed, as the ratio is which one of these bears to the other: that is, they must remain the same, and always speak the same language, till things cease to be what they are
</p><p>
I lay this down then as a fundamental maxim, <em>That whoever acts as if things were so, or not so, does by his acts declare, that they are so, or not so;</em> as plainly as he could by words, and with more reality. And if the things are otherwise, his acts contradict those propositions, which assert them to be as they are.<a>
</p><p>
<b>IV. No act (whether word<a> or deed) of any being, to whom moral good and evil are imputable, that interferes with any true proposition, or denies any thing to be as it is, can be right.</b> For,
</p><p>
1. If that proposition, which is false, be wrong,<a> that act which <em>implies</em> such a proposition, or is founded in it, cannot be right: because it is the very proposition itself in practice.
</p><p>
2. Those propositions, which are true, and express things as they are, express the <em>relation</em> between the subject and the attribute as it is; that is, this is either affirmed or denied of that according to the nature of <em>that relation</em>. And further, this relation (or, if you will, the nature of this relation) is determined and fixed by the natures of the things themselves. Therefore nothing can interfere with any proposition that is true, but it must likewise interfere with nature (the nature of the relation, and the natures of the things themselves too), and consequently be <em>unnatural</em>, or <em>wrong in nature</em>. So very much are those gentlemen mistaken, who by <em>following nature</em> mean only complying with their bodily inclinations, though in opposition to truth, or at least without any regard to it. Truth is but a conformity to nature: and to follow nature cannot be to combat truth.<a>
</p><p>
3. If there is a supreme being, upon whom the existence of the world depends; and nothing can be in it but what He either causes, or permits to be; then to own things <em>to be as they are</em> is to own what He causes, or at least permits, <em>to be thus caused or permitted</em>: and this is to take things as He gives them, to go into His constitution of the world; and to submit to His will, revealed in the books of nature.<a> To do this therefore must be agreeable to His will. And if so, the contrary must be disagreeable to it; and, since (as we shall find in due time) there is a perfect rectitude in His will, certainly <em>wrong</em>.
</p><p>
I desire that I may not be misunderstood in respect to the actings of wicked men. I do not say, it is agreeable to the will of God, that what is <em>ill</em> done by them, should be <em>so</em> done, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> that they should use their liberty ill: but I say, when they have done this and committed some evil, it is agreeable to His will, that we should allow it to <em>have been</em> committed: or, it would be disagreeable to His will, that we should <em>deny</em> it to have been committed.
</p><p>
As the owning of things, in all our conduct, to be as they are, is direct obedience:<a> so the contrary, not to own things to be or to have been that are or have been, or not to be what they are, is direct rebellion against Him, who is the Author of nature. For it is as much as to say, “God indeed causes such a thing to be, or at least permits it, and it is; or the relation, that lies between this and that, is of such a nature, that one may be affirmed of the other, <abbr>etc.</abbr> this is true: but yet to me it shall not be so: I will not endure it, or act as if it were so: the laws of nature are ill-framed, nor will I mind them, or what follows from them : even existence shall be non-existence, when my pleasures require.” Such an impious declaration as this attends every voluntary infraction of truth.
</p><p>
4. Things cannot be denied to be what they are, in any instance or manner whatsoever, without contradicting axioms and truths eternal. For such are these: <em>everything is what it is</em>; <em>that which is done, cannot be undone</em>; and the like. And then if those truths be considered as having always subsisted in the Divine mind, to which they have always been true, and which differs not from the Deity himself, to do this is to act not only in opposition to His government or sovereignty, but to His nature<a> also: which, if He be perfect, and there be nothing in Him but what is most right, must also upon this account be most wrong.
</p><p>
Pardon these inadequate ways of speaking of God. You will apprehend my meaning: which perhaps may be better represented thus. If there are such things as axioms, which are and always have been immutably true, and consequently have been always known to God to be so,</a> the truth of them cannot be denied any way, either directly or indirectly, but the truth of the Divine knowledge must be denied too.
</p><p>
5. Designedly to treat things as being what they are not is the greatest possible absurdity. It is to put bitter for sweet, darkness for light, crooked for straight, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> It is to subvert all science, to renounce all sense of truth, and flatly to deny the existence of anything. For nothing can be true, nothing does exist, if things are not what they are.
</p><p>
To talk to a post, or otherwise treat it as if it was a man, would surely be reckoned an absurdity, if not distraction.<a> Why? because this is to treat it as being what it is not. And why should not the converse be reckoned as bad; that is, to treat a man as a post;<a> as if he had no sense, and felt not injuries, which he does feel; as if to him pain and sorrow were not pain; happiness not happiness. This is what the cruel and unjust often do.
</p><p>
Lastly, To deny things to be as they are is a transgression of the great law of our nature, the law of reason. For truth cannot be opposed, but reason must be violated. But of this more in the proper place.
</p><p>
Much might be added here concerning the amiable nature,<a> and great force<a> of truth. If I may judge by what I feel within myself, the least truth cannot be contradicted without much reluctance: even to see other men disregard it does something more than displease; it is <em>shocking</em>.
</p><p>
<b>V. What has been said of acts inconsistent with truth, may also be said of many omissions, or neglects to act: that is, by these also true propositions may be denied to be true; and then those omissions, by which this is done, must be wrong for the same reasons with those assigned under the former proposition.</b>
</p><p>
Nothing can be asserted or denied by any act with regard to those things, to which it bears no relation: and here no truth can be affected. And when acts <em>do</em> bear such relations to other things, as to be declaratory of something concerning them, this commonly is visible; and it is not difficult to determine, whether truth suffers by them, or not. Some things cannot possibly be done, but truth must be directly and positively denied; and the thing will be clear. But the cases arising from omissions are not always so well determined, and plain: it is not always easy to know when or how far truth is violated by omitting. Here therefore more latitude must be allowed, and much must be left to every one’s own judgment and ingenuity.
</p><p>
This may be said in general, that when any truth would be denied by acting, the omitting to act can deny no truth. For no truth can be contrary to truth.<a> And there may be omissions in other cases, that are silent as to truth. But yet there are joint neglects or refusals to act, which are manifestly inconsistent with it (or, with some true propositions). We <a href="#anchor1">before</a> supposed A to have engaged not to do some certain thing, <abbr>etc.</abbr> if now, on the other side, he should by some solemn promise, oath, or other act undertake to do some certain thing before such a time, and he voluntarily<a> omits to do it, he would behave himself as if there had been no such promise or engagement; which is equal to denying there was any: and truth is as much contradicted in this as in the former instance.
</p><p>
Again, there are some ends, which the nature of things and truth require us to aim at, and at which therefore if we do not aim, nature and truth are denied. If a man does not desire to prevent evils, and to be happy, he denies both his own nature and the nature and definition of happiness to be what they are. And then further, willingly to neglect the <em>means</em>, leading to any such end, is the same as not to propose that end, and must fall under the same censure. As retreating from any end commonly attends the not advancing towards it, and that may be considered as an act, many omissions of this kind may be turned over to the other side,<a> and brought under the foregoing proposition.
</p><p>
It must be confessed there is a difficulty as to the means, by which we are to consult our own preservation and happiness: to know what those are, and what they are with respect to us. For our abilities and opportunities are not equal: some labor under disadvantages invincible: and our ignorance of the true natures of things, of their operations and effects in such an irregular distempered world, and of those many incidents, that may happen either to further or break our measures, deprive us of certainty in these matters. But still we may judge as well as we can, and do what we can;<a> and the neglect to do this will be an omission within the reach of the proposition.
</p><p>
There are omissions of other kinds, which will deserve to be annumerated to these by being either total, or notorious, or upon the score of some other circumstance. It is certain I should not deny the <i>Phœnissæ</i> of Euripides to be an excellent drama by not reading it: nor do I deny Chihil-menâr to be a rare piece of antiquity by nor going to see it. But should I, having leisure, health, and proper opportunities, read nothing, nor make any inquiries in order to improve my mind, and attain such knowledge as may be useful to me, I should then deny my mind to be what it is, and that knowledge to be what it is. And if it does not appear precisely, into what kind of studies this respect to truth will carry a man preferably to all others, how far it will oblige him to continue his pursuit after knowledge, and where the discontinuance begins to be no offence against truth, he must consult his own opportunities and genius, and judge for himself as well as he can.<a> This is one of those cases which I said before were not so well determined.
</p><p>
If I give nothing to this or that poor body, to whom I am under no particular obligation, I do not by this deny them to be poor, any more than I should deny a man to have a squalid beard by not shaving him, to be nasty by not washing him, or to be lame by not taking him on my back.
</p><p>
Many things are here to be taken into consideration (according to the next proposition): perhaps I might encroach upon truth by <em>doing</em> this; and then I cannot by <em>not doing</em> it.<a> But if I, being of ability to afford now and then something in charity to the poor, should yet never give them anything at all, I should then certainly deny the condition of the poor to be what it is, and my own to be what it is: and thus truth would be injured. So, again,
</p><p>
If I should not say my prayers at such a certain hour, or in such a certain place and manner, this would nor imply a denial of the existence of God, His providence, or my dependence upon Him: nay, there may be reasons perhaps against that particular time, place, manner. But if I should never pray to Him, or worship Him at all, such a total omission would be equivalent to this assertion, <i>There is no God, who governs the world, to be adored:</i> which, if there is such a being, must be contrary to truth. Also generally and notoriously to neglect this duty (permit me to call it so), though not quite always, will favor, if not directly proclaim the same untruth. For certainly to worship God after this manner is only to worship him accidentally, which is to declare it a great accident that he is worshipped at all, and this approaches as near as it is possible to a total neglect. Beside, such a sparing and infrequent worshipper of the Deity betrays such a habitual disregard of Him, as will render every religious act insignificant and null.
</p><p>
Should I, in the last place, find a man grievously hurt by some accident, fallen down, alone, and without present help like to perish; or see his house on fire, nobody being near to help, or call out: in this extremity if I do not give him my assistance immediately, I do not do it at all: and by this refusing to do it according to my ability, I deny his case to be what it is; human nature to be what it is; and even those desires and expectations, which I am conscious to myself I should have under the like misfortune, to be what they are.
</p><p>
<b>VI. In order to judge rightly what anything is, it must be considered not only what it is in itself or in one respect, but also what it may be in any other respect, which is capable of being denied by facts or practice: and the whole defeription of the thing ought to be taken in.</b>
</p><p>
If a man steals a horse, and rides away upon him, he may be said indeed by riding him to use him as a <em>horse</em>, but not as <em>the horse of another man</em>, who gave him no licence to do this. He does not therefore consider him as being what he is, unless he takes in the respect he bears to his true owner. But it is not necessary perhaps to consider what he is in respect to his color, shape, or age: because the thief’s riding away with him may neither affirm nor deny him to be of any particular color, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> I say therefore, that those, and all those properties, respects, and circumstances, which may be contradicted by practice, are to be taken into consideration. For otherwise the thing to be considered is but imperfectly surveyed; and the whole compass of it being not taken in, it is taken not as being what it is, but as what it is <em>in part</em> only, and in other respects perhaps as being what it is not.
</p><p>
If a rich man being upon a journey, should be robbed and stripped, it would be a second robbery and injustice committed upon him to take from him part of his then character, and to consider him only as a rich man. His character completed is a <em>rich man robbed and abused</em>, and indeed at that time a poor man<a> and distressed, though able to repay afterwards the assistance lent him.
</p><p>
Moreover a man in giving assistance of any kind to another should consider what his own circumstances are, as well as what the other’s are.<a> If they do not permit him to give it, he does not by his forbearance deny the other to want it: but if he should give it, and by that deny his own or his family’s circumstances to be what they are, he would actually contradict truth. And since (as I have observed already) all truths are consistent, nor can anything be true any further than it is compatible with other things that are true; when both parties are placed in a right light, and the case properly stated for a judgment, the latter may indeed be truly said to want assistance, but not the assistance of the former: any more than a man, who wants a guide, may be said to want a blind or a lame guide. By putting things thus may be truly known what the latter is with respect to the former.
</p><p>
The case becomes more difficult, when a man (A) is under some promise or compact to assist another (B), and at the same time bound to consult his own happiness, provide for his family, <abbr>etc.</abbr> and he cannot do these, if he does that, effectually. For what must A do? Here are not indeed opposite <em>truths</em>, but there are truths on opposite <em>sides</em>. I answer: though there cannot be two incompatible duties, or though two inconsistent acts cannot be both A’s duty at the same time (for then his duty would be an impossibility); yet an obligation, which I will call mixed, may arise out of those differing considerations. A should assist B; but so, as not to neglect himself and family, <abbr>etc.</abbr> and so to take care of himself and family, as not to forget the other engagement, as well and honestly as he can. Here the importance of the truths on the one and the other side should be diligently compared: and there must in such cases be always some exception or limitation understood. It is not in man’s power to promise absolutely. He can only promise as one, who may be disabled by the weight and incumbency of truths not then existing.
</p><p>
I could here insert many instances of partial thinking, which occur in authors: but I shall choose only to set down one in the margin.<a>
</p><p>
In short, when things are truly estimated, persons concerned, times, places,<a> ends intended,<a> and effects that naturally follow, must be added to them.
</p><p>
<b>VII. When any act would be wrong, the forbearing that act must be right: likewise when the omission of anything would be wrong, the doing of it (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> not omitting it) must be right.</b> Because <i xml:lang="la">contrariorum contraria est ratio</i>.
</p><p>
<b>VIII. Moral good and evil are coincident with right and wrong.</b> For that cannot be good, which is wrong; nor that evil, which is right.
</p><p>
<b>IX. Every act therefore of such a being, as is before described, and all those omissions which interfere with truth (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> deny any proposition to be true; which is true; or suppose anything not to be what it is, in any regard)<a> are morally evil, in some degree or other: the forbearing such acts, and the acting in opposition to such omissions are morally good: and when anything may be either done, or not done, equally without the violation of truth, that thing is indifferent.</b>
</p><p>
I would have it to be minded well, that when I speak of acts inconsistent with truth, I mean any truth; any true proposition whatsoever, whether containing matter of speculation, or plain fact. I would have everything taken to be what in fat and truth it is.<a>
</p><p>
It may be of use also to remember, that I have added those words <em>in some degree or other</em>. For neither all evil, nor all good actions are equal.<a> Those truths which they respect, though they are equally true, may comprise matters of very different importance;<a> or more truths may be violated one way than another:<a> and then the crimes committed by the violation of them may be equally (one as well as the other) said to be crimes, but not equal crimes.<a> If A steals a book from B which was pleasing and useful to him, it is true A is guilty of a crime in not treating the book as being what it is, the book of B, who is the proprietor of it, and one whose happiness partly depends upon it: but still if A should deprive B of a good estate, of which he was the true owner, he would be guilty of a much greater crime. For if we suppose the book to be worth to him one pound, and the estate £10,000, that truth, which is violated by depriving B of his book, is in effect violated 10,000 times by robbing him of his estate. It is the same as to repeat the theft of one pound 10,000 times over: and therefore if 10,000 thefts (or crimes) are more, and all together greater than one, one equal to 10,000 must be greater too: greater than that, which is but the 10,000th part of it, sure. Then, though the convenience and innocent pleasure, that B found in the use of the book, was a degree of happiness: yet the happiness accruing to him from the estate, by which he was supplied not only with necessaries, but also with many other comforts and harmless enjoyments, vastly exceeded it. And therefore the truth violated in the former case was, <i>B had a property in that, which gave him such a degree of happiness:</i> that violated in the latter, <i>B had a property in that, which gave him a happiness vastly superior to the other</i>. The violation therefore in the latter case is upon this account a vastly greater violation than in the former. Lastly, the, truths violated in the former case might end in B, those in the latter may perhaps be repeated in them of his family, who subsist also by the estate, and are to be provided for out of it. And these truths are very many in respect of every one of them, and all their descendents. Thus the degrees of evil or guilt are as the importance and number of truth violated.<a> I shall only add, on the other side, that the value of good actions will rise at least in proportion to the degrees of evil in the omission of them: and that therefore they cannot be equal, any more than the opposite evil omissions.
</p><p>
But let us return to that, which is our main subject, the distinction between moral good and evil. Some have been so wild as to deny there is any such thing: but from what has been said here, it is manifest, that there is as certainly moral good and evil as there is true and false; and that there is as natural and immutable a difference between those as between these, the difference at the bottom being indeed the same.<a> Others acknowledge, that there is indeed moral good and evil; but they want some criterion, or mark, by the help of which they might know them apart. And others there are, who pretend to have found that rule, by which our actions ought to be squared, and may be discriminated; or that ultimate end, to which they ought all to be referred:<a> but what they have advanced is either false, or not sufficiently guarded, or not comprehensive enough, or not clear and firm,<a> or (so far as it is just) reducible to <em>my</em> rule. For
</p><p>
They, who reckon nothing to be good but what they call <i xml:lang="la">honestum</i>,<a> may denominate actions according as that is, or is not the cause<a> or end<a> of them: but then what is <i xml:lang="la">honestum</i>?<a> Something is still wanting to measure things by, and to separate the <i xml:lang="la">honesta</i> from the <i xml:lang="la">inhonesta</i>.
</p><p>
They who place all in following nature,<a> they mean by that phrase acting according to the natures of things (that is, treating things as being what they in nature are, or according to truth) say what is right. But this does not seem to be their meaning. And if it is only that a man must follow his own nature,<a> since his nature is not purely rational, but there is a part of him, which he has in common with brutes, they appoint him a guide which I fear will mislead him, this being commonly more likely to prevail, than the rational part. At best this talk is loose.
</p><p>
They who make <em>right reason</em><a> to be the law, by which our acts are to be judged, and according to their conformity to this or deflection from it call them lawful or unlawful, good or bad, say something more particular and precise. And indeed it is true, that whatever will bear to be tried by right reason, is right; and that which is condemned by it, wrong. And moreover, if by right reason is meant that which is found by the right use of our rational faculties, this is the same with truth: and what is said by them, will be comprehended in what I have said. But the manner in which they have delivered themselves, is not yet explicit <em>enough</em>.</a> It leaves room for so many disputes and opposite right-reasons, that nothing can be settled, while every one pretends that <em>his</em> reason is right. And beside, what I have said, extends farther: for we are not only to respect those truths, which we discover by reasoning, but even such matiers of fact, as are fairly discovered to us by our senses. We ought to regard things as being what they are, which way soever we come to the knowledge of them.
</p><p>
They, who contenting themselves with superficial and transient views, deduce the difference between good and evil from the <em>common sense</em> of mankind,<a> and certain <em>principles</em><a> that are born with us,<a> put the matter upon a very infirm foot. For it is much to be suspected there are no such innate maxims as they pretend, but that the impressions of education are mistaken for them: and beside that, the sentiments of mankind are not uniform and constant, as that we may safely trust such an important distinction upon them.<a>
</p><p>
They, who own nothing to be good but <em>pleasure</em>, or what they call <i xml:lang="la">jucundum</i>, nothing evil but pain,<a> and distinguish things by their tendencies to this or that,<a> do not agree in what this pleasure is to be placed,<a> or by what methods and actings the most of it may be obtained. These are left to be questions still. As men have different tastes, different degrees of sense and philosophy, the same thing cannot be pleasant to all: and if particular actions are to be proved by this test, the morality of them will be very uncertain; the same act may be of one nature to one man, and of another to another. Beside, unless there be some strong limitation added as a fence for virtue, men will be apt to sink into gross voluptuousness, as in fact the generality of Epicurus’s herd have done<a> (notwithstanding all his talk of temperance, virtue, tranquility of mind, <abbr>etc.</abbr>); and the bridle will be usurped by those appetites which it is a principal part of all religion, natural as well as any other, to curb and restrain. So these men say what is intelligible indeed: but what they say is false. For not all pleasures, but only such pleasure as is <em>true</em>, or happiness (of which afterwards), may be reckoned among the <i xml:lang="la">fines</i>, or <i xml:lang="la">ultima bonorum</i>.
</p><p>
He,<a> who, having considered the two extremes in men’s practice, in condemning both which the world generally agrees, places virtue in the <em>middle</em>, and seems to raise an idea of it from its situation at an equal distance from the opposite extremes,<a>


<li><i xml:lang="la">Negat Epicurus jucundè vivi posse, nisi cum virtute vivatur</i> “Epicurus denies that anyone can live pleasantly, that does not live virtuously” (Cicero). But for all that their pleasures have not continued to be always like those in the little gardens of Gargettus. Nor indeed do they seem to be very virtuous even there. For Epicurus not only had his Leontium (or, as he amorously called her, <i xml:lang="grc">Λεοντάριον</i>, “his pretty poppet”) a famous harlot; but she <i xml:lang="grc">πᾶσί τε τοῖς Επικουρείοις συνήν ἐν τοῖς κήποις</i> “laid with all the Epicureans in the gardens” (Athenaeus). And in his book <i xml:lang="grk">περὶ τέλους</i> “of perfection” he is said to have written thus, <i xml:lang="grk">Οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγε ἔχω τί νοήσω τἀγαθόν, ἀφαιρῶν μὲν τὰς διὰ χυλῶν</i> (<i xml:lang="grc">χειλῶν</i> Athenaeus) <i xml:lang="grc">ἡδονάς, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ καὶ τὰς δι᾿ ἀφροδισίων, κλ</i> “There is nothing that I esteem good, if you take away the pleasure which arises from eating and drinking and women” (see this and more in Diogenes Laertius).</li>
<li><abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome uses the plural number, as if this was the prevailing notion in his time. <i xml:lang="la">Philosophorum sententia est</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">μεσότητας ἀρετὰς, ὑπερβολὰς κακίας εἶναι</i> “It is the opinion of the philosophers, that virtues consist in the middle, and vices in the extremes.”</li>

could only delign to be understood of such vir-
tues, as have extremes. It must be granted indeed,
that whatever declines in any degree toward eitber
extreme, must be so far wrong or evil ; and there-
' fore that, which equally (or nearly) divides the di-
ﬁance, and declines neither way, must be right :
also, that his notion fupplies us with a good a’zree-
tion for common use in many cases. But then there
are several obligations, that can by no means be de-
rived from it: scarce more than such, as respect the-
virtues couched under the word moderation. And ‘
even as to these, it is many times difﬁcult to dif-
cern, which is the middle point m. This the author
himself was sensible of “.

ﬁft in such a likenefc to God °, as we are capable of

“ the other of defect.” Aars'r. Perhaps Pjtlmgoreu (and after

shall not dispute. But since he tells us not how or
by What means we may attain this likenefs, we are
little the wifer in point of practice: unless by it
we underl’tand the praetice of truth, God being
truth, and doing nothing contrary to it P.
Whether any of those other foundations, upon
which morality has been built, will hold better

the dg'ﬂinttz'on seems to be settled in a manner un- ‘

meant by a true propoﬂtz'on and matter of fat?I is
perfectly understood by every body; so will it be
easy for any one, so far as he knOws any such pro-
poﬁtions and facts, to compare nor only words, but

X. If tbere be moral good and evil, di/iingui/bd a:
before, tbere is religion; and fueb as may moji pro-
perly be flyled natural. By‘ religion I mean norhing
' else but an obligation to do (under which word I
comprehend acts both of body and mind. I say, to
do) what ought not to be omitted, and to forbear
what ought not to be done. So that there must be
religion, if there are things, of which some ought
not to be done, some not to be omitted. But that
there are such, appears from what has been said
concerning moral good and evil: because that,
which to omit would be evil, and which therefore
being done would be good or well done, ought
certainly by the terms to be done; and so that,
which being done would be evil, and implies such
abfurdities and rebellion against the supreme be-
ing, as are mentioned under proposition the IVth.
ought moit undoubtedly not to be done. And then
since there is religion, which follows from the dif-
tinétion between moral good and evil; since this
diﬂinétion is founded in the respect, which mens
acts bear to truth ; and since no pr0polition can be
true, which expreﬂ'es things otherwise than as they
are in nature : since things are so, there must: be re-
ligion, which is founded in nature, and may upon
that account be moit properly and truly called the
religion of nature or natural religion ; the great law.
of which religion, the law of nature, or rather (as
we shall afterwards find reason to call it) of the
Author of nature is,

To the ﬁrﬂ objeé‘tion it is easy to reply from
what has been already said. For if the obje&or’s
enemy, whom we will. call E, was nothing more
than his enemy, there might be some force in the
objection; but since he may be confiderd as some-
thing else beside that, he must be used according
to what he is in other respects, as well as in that
from which he is denominated the objector’s (or
O’s) enemy. F orE in the ﬁri’c place is a mom 3 and
as such may claim the beneﬁt of common huma-
nity, whatever that is: and if 0 denies it to him,
he wounds truth in a very sensible part. And then
if 0 and E are fellow-citizens, living under the
same-government, and subject to laws, which are
so many common covenants, limiting the behavi-
our of one man to another, and by which E is ex-
empt from all private violence in his body, estate,
£36. 0 cannot treat E as being what he is, unless
he treats him also as one, who by, common consent
is under such a prote&ion. If he does otherwise,
he denies the exii’tence of - the forefaid laws and
public compacts: contrary to truth. And befide,

he is; a man himself, in such or such circumi’cances,
and one who has given up all right to private re-
venge (for that is the thing meant here). If truth
therefore be observed, the result will be this. 0
must treat E as famet/aiag compounded of a man, a
fellow-citizen, and an enemy, all three: that is,
he must only prosecute him in such a way, as is
agreeable to the ﬁatutes and methods, which the
fociety have obliged themselves to observe. And
even as to legal projeeatz'om, there may be many
things still to be considered. For B may Ihew him-
self an enemy to O in things, that fall under the
cogniZance of law, which yet may be of moment
and importance to him, or not. If they are such
things, as really alfeét the fafety or happineﬂr of O
or his family, then he will find himself obliged, in
duty and fubmiﬂion to truth, to take refuge in the
laws; and to punifh E, or obtain fatisfaction, and
at leaﬂt fecurity for the future, by the means there
prefcribed. Because if he does not, he denies the
nature and jeaﬂe of happiness to be what they are ;
the obligations, which perhaps we shall show here-
after he, is under to his famzZy ‘, to be what they
are ; a dangerous and wicked enemy to be danger-
ous and wicked; the end of laws, and .fociety it-
self, to be the fafety and good of its members, by

it will appear to be, when that matter comes before
us. But if the enmity of E rifes not beyond triﬁng,
or more tolerable instances, then 0 might act againf’t
truth, if he should be at more charge or hazard in
profecuting E than he can afford, or the thing 1011
or in danger is worth; should treat one that is an
enemy in little things, or a little enemy, as a great
one -, or should deny to make some allowances, and
forgive such peccadillo’s, as the common frailty of
humannature makes it neceﬂ'ary for us mutually
to forgive, if we will live together. La/lbv, in
cases, of which the laws of the place take no no-
tice, truth and nature would be sufficiently ob-
served, if 0 should keep a vigilant eye upon the
steps of his adverfary, and take the molt prudent
measures, that are compatible with the character
of a private person, either to aﬂ'wage the malice
of E, or prevent the effects of it; or perhaps, if
he should only not use him as a friend “. For this
if he should do, notwithi’tanding the rants of some
men, he would cancel the natural differences of
things, and confound truth with untruth.

The debtor in the jecoml objection, if he acts as
he lays there, does, in the first place, make himself
the judge of his creditor, which is what he is not.
For he lays him under a heavy sentence, an incapa-

' city in eﬁ'eél: of having any estate, or any more
el’tate;. In the next place, he arrogates to himself

more than can be true: that he perfeé‘tly knows, '

not only what his creditor and his circumltances

are, but also what they ever will be hereafter. He
that is now weak, or extravagant, or very rich,
may for ought he knows become Otherwife. And,
which is to be considered above all, he directly de-
nies the money, which is the creditor’s, to be the
creditor’s. For it is supposed to be owing or due to
him otherwise he is no creditor): and if it be due
to him, (he has a right to it : and if. he has a right
to it, of right it is his (or, it is his). But the debtor

therefore not the Other’s; contrary to truth. To pay

truth, as that phrase is used in the objection, is not
the thing required by my rule; but, so to act that
_ no-truth may be denied by any act. Not taking
from another man his money by violence is a for-
bearance, which does not signify, that I do not
want money, or which denies anytrurh. But tak-

'tion) ‘1': bit. The former is only as it were filencc,
which denies nothing: the latter a direét and loud
aﬁértion of a falsity; the former what can contra-
dict no truth, because the latter does. If a man
wants money through his own extravagance and
-'yice, there can be no pretence for making another
man to pay for his wickedness or folly. We will

want it for necgﬂaries, and to have incurred this

prevent. In this case, which is put as strong as can
be for the objector, there are ways- of expreﬁing

truth will oblige to aﬂilt him according totheir

HAT, which demands to be next considered,
is bappine/i ; as being in itself mof’t confider-
able; as abetting the cause of truth; and as being
indeed so nearly allied to it, that they cannot well
be parted. We cannot pay the respects'due to one,
unless we regard the other. Happinefs must not be
denied to be what it is: and it is by the practice of
truth that we aim at that happiness, which is true.
In the few following propositions I fhall not on-
1y give you my idea of it, but also fubjoin some ob-
fer'uatiom, which tho perhaps not neceﬁ‘ary here,
we may fometime hereafter think no loss of time
or laborto have made en pastbnt: such as men of
science would call, some of them porifmata, or co-
rollaries, and same febolia, Iihall take them as they
fall in my way promifcuoufly.

I. Plea/are is a con/ciauﬁze/i of something agree-
able, pain of the contraiy : 8: v. v. the conﬁiouﬁiefr
of any thing agreeable is pleasure, of the contraiy
pain. For as nothing, that is agreeable to us, can
be painful at the same time, and as such; nor any
thing disagreeable pleasant, by the term: ; so neither
can any thing agreeable be for that reafoa (because
it is agreeable) not pleasant, nor any thing disagree-
able not painful, in some measure or other.

Obf.

Of Happinefs.’ '5‘?

Obf. I . Plea/are: and pain: are proportionable to
the perception: and fen/é of tbeir subjects, or the per-
fom aﬂeﬁed wit/a them. For confcioufnefs and per-
ception cannot be separated : because as I do not
perceive what I am not conscious to myself I do
perceive, ‘so neither can I be conscious of what I do
not perceive, or of more or less than what I do
perceive. And therefore, since the degrees of plea-
fure or pain must be answerable to the confciouf-
nefs, which the party affected has of them, they
must likewise be as the degrees of perception are.

Obf. 2. Warmer z'mreqfer tbepower of perceiving,
render: the peralpz'eﬂt more ﬂtﬂepti've of pleasure or .
pain. This is an immediate confequence ; and to
add more is needlefs : unless, that among the
means, by which perceptions and the inward sense
of things may in many cases be heightend andz'n-
cred/Zed, the principal are rqﬂexion, and the practice
of thinking. As I cannot be conscious of what I
do not perceive: so I do 'not perceiVe that, which I
do not advert upon. That which makes me feel,
makes me advert. Every inﬁzance therefore of con~
fcioufnefs and perception is attended with an act
of advertence: and as the more the perceptions
are, the more are the advertences or reflections; so
7:. v. the more frequent or intense the acts of ad-
vertence and reflection are, the more confcioufnefs
there is,'and the stronger is the perception. Fun/yer,
all perceptions are produced in time: time past'es
by moments : there can be but one moment pre-
sent ,at once: and therefore all present perception

considered without any relation to what is paft, or
‘ E 3 future,

'54 The RELIGION of‘NA'rUnn. Se&.II.

future, may be lookd upon as momentaneous only.
In this kind of perception the percipient perceives,
as if he had not perceived any thing before, nor had
any thing perceptible to follow. But in reflection
there is a repetition of what is pail, and an antici-
pation of that which is apprehended as yet to come :
there is a connection of pail: and future, which by this
are brought into the fum, and fupei'added to the
present or momentaneous perceptions. Again, by
reﬂeé‘ting we praélife our capacity of apprehend~
, ing : and this practiﬁng will increase, and as it were
extend that capacity, to a certain degree. Laﬂly, re-
ﬂexion does not only accumulate moments pail:
and future to those that are present, but even in
their past'age it seems to multiply them. For time,
as well asfpace, is capable of indeterminate diviﬁ-
on : and the finer or nicer the advertence or reﬂexi-
On is, into the more parts is the time divided ; which,
whillt the mind considers those parts as so many fe-
veral moments, is in mfet? renderd by this so much
the longer. And to this experience agrees.

Obf. 3. The can/2’: of pleasure and pain are rela-
tive things : and in order to alienate truly their #23?
upon any particular fuhjet't' they ought to he drawn
into the degrees of perception in that fuhjeﬁ. When
the cause is of the same kind, and acts with an
equal force, if the perception of one person be equal
to that of another, what they perceive muf’c needs
be equal. And so it will be likewise, when the
forces in the producing causes and the degrees of
perception in the fentients are reciprocal. For (which
does not seem to be considered by the world, and
therefore ought the more particularly to be acted)

‘ if

‘ 0f Happinefs. '55
if the cause of pleasure or pain should aé't but half
as much upon A, as it does upon B; yet if the per--
ceptivity of A be double to that of B, the fum of
their pleasures or pains will be equal. In other cases
they will be unequal. As, if the cau/Zz doloriﬁca
should aél: with the same impetus on C with which
it aé'ts upon D ; yet if C had only two degrees of
perception, and D had three, the pain fuﬁaind by
D would be half as much more as that of C : be-
cause he would perceive or feel the acts and im-
preﬂions of the cause more by so much. If it should
act with twice the force upon D which it act's with
upon C, then the pain of C would be to that of D
as 2 to 6 : i.e. as one degree of force multiplied by
two degrees of perception to two degrees of force
multiplied by three of perception. And so on.

Obf. 4. Mn: re/‘pec‘ti've happimﬂe: or plea/urea
ought to he valued as they are to the persons them-
felves, who/l: they are; or according to the thoughts
and ﬂit/2’, which they have of them : not according
to the eﬂzimate put upon them by other people,
who have no authority to judge of them, nor can
know what they are; may compute by different
rules; have less sense; be in different circumftan-
ces ‘5 or such as guilt has renderd partial to them-
felves. If that prince, who having plenty and flocks
many, yet ravifhd the poor man’s lingle ewe-

lambs would have been to him, he must be very

the doctrine of proportion. Every man’s happiness
is his happiness, what it is to him -, and the loss of

known) the persons immediately concerned can

them. For it is certain, all criminals are not of the
former kind; and therefore should nor be used as if,
they: were. Some are drawn into crimes, which
may render them obnoxious to public justice, they
scarce know how themselves : some fall into them
thro necefﬁty, firength of temptation, defpair, e-
laﬁicity of spirits and a fudden eruption of pallion,
ignorance of laws, want of good education, or some
natural infirmity or propenﬁon, and some who are

Time and life without thinking are next neigh—
hours to . notbz'ng, to no-time and no-life k. And
therefore to kill a brute is to deprive him of a life,
or a remainder of time, that is equal to little more
than nothing: tho this may perhaps be more appli-
cable toifome animals than to others. That, which
is chiefly to be taken care of in this matter, is,
that the brute may not be killed unnecelTarily ;
when it is killed, that it may have as few moments
of pain as may be I 5 and that no young be left to

Be avoided. What is here said, refpeé'ts mere plea-
fure and pain, abi’cracted from all circumstances,
confequences, 8:. But because there are some of
these generally adhering to them, and such as enter
[0 deep into their nature, that unless these be taken
in, the full and true character of the other cannot
be had, nor can it therefore be known what bappi—
vne/Ic is, I must: proceed to fom'e other propositions
relating to this fubjeé‘t.

' IV. Plea/are compared with pain may eitber to
equal, or more, or left : also pleasure: may be com-
pared. wit/o other pleasure: m, and pains wit/9 pains.
Because all the moments of the pleasure must bear
some refpeél: or be in some ratio to all the moments
of pain : as also all the degrees of one to all the de-
grees of the Other: and so muf’c those of one plea-
fure, or one pain, he to those of another. And if
the degrees of intensenefs be multiplied by the mo-
ments of duration, there must: ﬁill be some ratio
of the one produél: to the other.

That this proposition is true, appears from the
general conduct of mankind; tho in some particu-
lars they may err, and wrong themselves, some
more, some less. For what dorh all this hurry of

business, what do all the labors and travels of men
tend to,‘ but to gain such advantages, as they think
do exceed all their trouble? What are all their ab-
ﬁinences and self—denials for, if they do not think
some pleasures less than the pain, that would ﬁle-
ceed them? Do not the various‘ methods of life
fbew, that men prefer one fort of pleasure to ano-
ther, and submit to one fort of pain rather than to
have another ? And within ourfelves we cannot but
find an indifference as to many things, not caring,
whether we have the pain with the pleasure obtained
by it, or mifs the pleasure, being excused from the
pain. i

V. When pleafare: and pain: are equal, they mu-
tually ale/troy each other : when the one exceeds, the
exaﬂ gives the true quantity of pleasure or pain. For
nine degrees of pleasure, less by nine degrees of
pain, are equal to nothing: but nine degrees of
one, less by three degrees .of the other, give fix of
the former net and true.

VI. A: therefore there may he true pleasure and
pain : so there may he some pleasures, which compared
with what attend: or follow: them, not only may
‘vanz'fh into nothing, hut may even degenerate into
pain, and ought to he rechond as pain: “; and v. 'v.

kind of pleasure, which is true (clear of all difcounts
and future payments): nor can the true quantity of
pain not be the same with that quantity of true or
mere pain. Then, the man who enjoys three de-
grees offuch pleasure as will bring upon him nine
degrees of pain, when three degrees of pain are set
oﬂ’ to balance and link the three of pleasure, can
have remaining to him only fix degrees of pain:
and into these therefore is his pleasure finally re-
folved. And 13 the three degrees of pain, which
any one indures to obtain nine of pleasure, end in
fix of the latter. By the same manner of comput—
ing some pleasures will be found to be the loss of
pleasure, compared with greater: and some pains

the alleviation of pain -, because by undergoing
' them greater' are evaded'°. Thus the natures of
pleasures and pains are varied, and sometimes tranfg
muted: which ought never to be forgot.

Nor this neither. As in the sense of mof’t men, I
believe, a little pain will weigh againf’t a great deal
of pleasurell’ :‘ 3 so perhaps there may be some pains,
which exceed all pleasures; that is, fuc’h pains as
no man would choose to fuﬁer for any pleasure
whatever, or at l‘eaft any that we know of in this
world. So ' that it is poﬂible the difference, -or ex-
cefs of pain, may rife so high as to become immenfe :'
and then the pleasure to be set against that pain will
be but a point, or cypher: a quantity of no‘valueé,

VII. Happineﬂs diﬂ'er: not from the true quantity
of pleasure, unbappz’mﬁ of pain. Or, any being may
be find to be [0 far bappy, as his pleasure: are true,
&c. That cannot be the happiness of any being,
which is bad for him: nor can happiness be difa-
greeable. It mull be something therefore, that is
both agreeable and good for the poﬂelibr. Now prev
sent pleasure is for the .present indeed agreeable;
but if it be not true, and he who iry'oys it mull pay
more for it than it is worth, it cannot be for his
good, or good for him. This therefore cannot be
his bappz'nefr. Nor, again, can that pleasure be reck-
ond happiness, for which one pays the full price in
pain : because these are quantities which mntually
deﬂroy each Other. But yet since happinessjs some-
thing, which, by the general idea of it, must be
deﬁrable, and therefore agreeable, it mul‘c be some
kind of pleasure ‘1: and this, from what has been
laid, can only be such pleasure as is true. That only
can be both agreeable and good for him. And thus
every one’s happiness will be as his true quantity
of pleasure.

One, that loves to make objebtz’om, may demand
here, whether there may not be happiness without
pleasure: whether a man, may not~ be said to be
happy in refpec‘l to those evils, which he efcapes,
and yet knows nothing of : and whether there may
act be such a thing as negative happiness. I answer,
an exemption from misfortunesand pains is a high
privilege, tho we should not be sensible what those

misfortunes 'or dangers are, from which we are de-
liverd, and in the larger use of the word may be
ﬁyled a happiness. Also, the abfence of pain or un-
happiness may perhaps .be called negative happi-
nefs, since the meaning of that phrase is known.
But in proper speaking happiness always includes
something poﬁtive. For mere indolence resulting
from infenﬁbility, or joind with it, if it be happi-
nefs, is a happiness inﬁnitely diminifhd: tba't is, it
is no more a happiness, than it is an unhappiness;
upon the‘conﬁne of both, but neither. At beﬂ: it is
but the happiness of Rocks and Ptones ' : and to
these I think happiness can hardly be in ﬁriétneis
allowed. ’Tisnthe privilege of a flock to be what it ‘
is, rather than to be a miferable being: this we are
fenfible of, and therefore, joining this privilege
with our own sense of it, we call it happiness ; but
this is what it is in our manner of apprehending it,
not what it is in the flock itself. A sense indeed of
being free from pains and troubles is attended with
happiness: but then the happiness ﬂows from the
ﬂea/e of the case, and is a paﬁtz've happiness. Whilﬂ:
a man reflects upon his negative happiness, as it is
called, and injoys it, he makes it poﬁtive -: and per-
haps a sense of immunity from the aﬂiiéiions and
miferies every where so obvious to our obfervation
is one of the greatqﬂ pleasures in this world.

IX. To make it/Ielf happy is a duty, which every
being, in proportion to its capacity, owe: to itself ;
and that, which every intelligent being may be fup-
pofed to aim at, in general ‘. For happiness is form:
quantity of true pleasure : and that pleasure, which
.I call true, may be considered by itself, and so will
be jul’tly deﬁrable (according to pr0p. II, and III).

~On the contrary, unhappiness is certainly to be a-‘

voided : because being a quantity of mere pain, it
may be considered by itself, as a real, mere evil,
8e. and because if I am obliged to pursue happi-
nefs, I am at the same time obliged to recede, as
far as I can, from its contrary. All this is self-evi-
dent. And hence it follows, that,

and to suppose, that an inferior being may in op-

to suppose that being more pOtent than the Author,
of nature, and consequently more potent than the
author of the nature and power of that very being
himself, which is abfurd. And as to the other part
of the propositiongit is aifo abfund to think, that,
by the coni’titution of nature and will of its author,
any being should be finally miferable only for (one
forming himself to truth, and owning things and i
the relations lying between them to be what they
are. It is much the same as to say, God has made
it natural to contradict nature; or unnatural, and
therefore punifhab-le, to act according to nature
and reality. If such a blunder (excuse the boldnefs
of the word) could be, it .muﬁ come either thro a

equitable scheme, or from some delight, which he
finds in the misery of his dependents. The former

there are none of us all, who have not many enjoy-

not one of them would be otherwise in any re-

a beautiful, admirable fyf’tem, in which there is
only a mixture of evils, could have been only a
fcene of mere misery, horror, and torment.

That either the enemies of truth (wicked men)
should be ultimately happy, or the religious ob-
servers of it (good men) ultimately unhappy, is such
injuﬂice, and an evil so great, that fure no Mani-

these enjoyments, nor the means by which they are

unjult, immoderate, or the like ". For in this case
there is no reason why we should not desire them,
and a direct one, why we should -, 'vz'z. because they
are enjoyments.

XIV. To conclude this feétion, The way to Imp-
pine]: and the practice of truth incur the one into the
other V. For no being can be ﬁyled happy, that is
not ultimately so: because if all his pains exceed all
his pleasures, he is so far from being happy, that
he is a being unhappy or miferable, in proportion
to that excefs. Now by prop. XI. nothing Can pro-
duce the ultimate happiness of any being, which
interferes with truth : and therefore whatever dOth
produce that, must be something which is conﬁfto
but and coincident with this. .

Two things then (but such as are met together,

oully regarded in all our conduct, are truth (of

things and cases as 'they occur. We reason about
particulars, or from them; but not by them.

In faé'l: we find Within ourfelves-many logical,
metaplagﬁtal, mathematical ideas, no one of which
is limited to any particular, or individual thing:
but they comprehend whole claﬂe: and kinds. And
it is by the help of these that we reason, and de-
monitrate. So that we know from within ourfelves,
that intelligent beings not only may have such ab-
ﬂract ideas, as are mentionedin the proposition,
but that ibme aﬁaally ba‘ve them: which is enough
for my purpose.

III. 51" 60/2 ideas or objeﬂs, that are immediate,
will ﬁe adegaately and truly known to that mind,
tuba/e ideas tiny are. For ideas can be no further the
idea: of any mind, than that mind has (or may
have) a perception of them: and therefore that
mind mult perceive the whole of them; which is
to know them adequately.

Again, there idea: being immediate, nothing (by
the term) can intervene to increase, diminifh, or
any way alter them. And to say the mind does
not know them truly, implies a contradiction : be-
cause it is the same as to say, that they are mifre,
presented; that is, that there are intervening and
mifrepresenting ideas.

' And lajtly, there cannot be an immediate per-g
' ception of that, which is not 5 nor therefor.e 9f any
immediate object otherwise, than as it is. We have
indeed many times wrong notions, and mifper-

which may be vitiated, or perhaps are defective at
belt and incapable of tranfrnitting things as they
are in themselves, and therefore occasion imperfth
and false images; But then, even in this case, those
images and ideas that are immediate to the perci-
pient, are perceived as they are: and that is the
very reason, why the originals, which they should
exhibit truly, but do not, are not perceived as they
are. In ihort, I only say the mind must know its
own immediate ideas. ' - -

For if the relation be immediate, the ideas cannot

relations, lying as it were all before Him, and per-

that He is, not obliged to make use of our operofe

in a manner inﬁnitely above all our conceptions.

have, is a thing no: to be told by me ; or how far
they may excell us in this way of finding truth. I

It cannot be amiss to note furtber, that tho 3
man, who truly uses his rational powers, has ab-
Itraft and universal ideas, obtained by reflection ; out
of these frames to himself general truths, or. ap-
prehends the firength of such, and admits them,
when they occur to him 3 by these, as by so many
ﬁandards, measures and judges of things 5 and
takes care to have the materials; which he makes
use of in reasoning, to be rivetted and compacted
together by them} yet by a babit of reasoning he
may come to serve himself of them, and apply them
so quick, that he himself shall scarce observe it.
Nay, molt men seem to reason by virtue of a ha-
bit acquired by conversation, practice in business,
and examples of others, without knowing what it
is, that gives the solidity even to their own juﬂ
reasonings : just as men usually learn rules in arith-
metic, govern their accounts by them all , their
days, and grow very ready and tepping in the use
, of them, without ever knowing or-troubling their .
heads about the demorgﬂmtion of any one of them.

or even being aware that there are any such, as it
were by rule or a kind of rote; yet such there are,
and upon them ref’ts the weight of reason as its
foundation.

This, by the way, helps us to. dete& the cause,
why the generality of pe0ple are so little under the
dominion of reason : why they facriﬁce it to their in-
terefts and pafiions so easily ; are so obnoxious to
prejudices, the influence of their company, and
din of a party ; so apt to change, tho the case re-
mains the very same; so unable to judge of things,
that are‘ever so little out of the way -, and so con-
ceited and politive in matters, that are doubtful,
or. perhaps to discerning persons maniﬁellly false.
Their reasoning proceeds in that track, which they
happen to be got into, and out of which they 'know

according to the quality of that proposition, or.
those propositions, from which the inference is
made. >
Again; it should be observed, that what I have
said of reasoning, chiefly belongs to it as it is an
internal Operation. When we are to present our
reasonings to others, we must: transfer our thoughts
to them by such ways as we can. The case is to be
Rated in a manner suitable to their capacities; a
-fair narration of matters of fact, and their circum-
ﬁances, to be made ; many times persons and things
to be described by proper (ﬂame/2:, and the like :
all which are additional labor, and take-up much
room in difcourses and books, and are performed
by different authors, upon different subjects, and
in different kinds of writing, with an inﬁnite va-
riety of methods and forms, according to mens
different views and capacities -, and many times not
without a necefiity of same condefcenﬁons, afciti-
tious advantages, and even applications to the paf-
lions. But notwithﬂzanding this, in Itriéi reasoning
nothing is required, but to lay s’teps in a due order,
firmly connected, and expreﬁ properly, without
ﬂourish m; and to arrive at truth by the jbortcflyand
downy} gradation we are able. '
Once more; perhaps difputacious men may say
I ascribe the invef’tigation of truth to one faculty,

For when we'g'o about this work, we a‘reforced to
make use of fubordinate powers, and even external
helps; to draw diagram, and put cafesin our own

ﬂ’rutb may be dzfca'verd by reafom‘ng 5‘. The word
reaﬁn has several acceptations. Sometimes it is used
for that power mentioned in the last: proposition -,
as when we say, Man is a being indued wit}: red/072.
And then the sense of this proposition must be this;
that there is sugh a use to be made of this power,
as is' right, and will manifeit truth. Sometimes it
seems to be taken for those general truths, of which
the mind poli'eﬂ‘es itself from the intimate know-
ledge ofﬂits own ideas, and by which it is governed
in its illations and concluﬁons; as when we say,
Saab a thing is agreed]: i0 reason : for that is as
much as to say, it is agreeable to the said general
truths, and that authentic ‘way ofmaking dedué‘ti-
pm, which is founded in them. And then the sense
of this] proposition is, that there are such general
truths, and such a right way of inferring. Again;
sometimes it seems to Rand only for ionic particu-
‘ Iar truth, as it is apprehended by the mind with

Other truth : that is, it difl'Ers not from truth exo'
cept in this one respect, that it is considered not bare-
ly in itself, but as the dice} and result of a‘ proce£s
of reasoning ; or it is truth with the arguments for
. our aﬂént, and its evidences about it; as when it
is said, that fuel: or ﬂat: an qﬂ'ertz'on is reaﬁn.-' And
then the sense of the proposition is, that there are
truths so to be apprehended by the mind. So all
comes to’ this at laﬁ -, truth (or there are truths,
Which) may be discovered, or found to be such, by
reafom’ng.

If it were not so, our rational faculties, the no-:
bleft we have, would be vain. .

’Tis certain we have immediate and abﬁract 12:21::

help of our senses, or present themselves'by any
other way or means, to which theft truths may be
o immediately applied, or from whence deduétions
may be made after the forementioned manner, new
truths may be thus colleﬂed. And since these new
truths, and the numerous defcendents, that may
fpring from their loins, may be used stillr in the same
manner, and be as it‘ were the feed of more truth,

cularly of that kind, which is mof’t u/éful to us in
our conduct here, is discoverable by this method.

They, who Oppugn the force and certainty of
reason, and treat right reajbn as a Cbimaem, must
argue againl’t reason either with reason, or without
reason. In the latter way they do nothing: and in
the former they betray their own cause, and dia-

there is no such thing as right reason by any good.

be to show there is such a thing, by the manner of
proving, that there, is not.

And further, if this proposition be not true,
there is no right r'eafoning in Euclid; nor can we
be fure, that what is there demonltrated, is true.
But to say this I am fure is abfurd. Nor do I de-
fire, that this proposition, which I here maintain,
should be ei’ceemd more certain than. those demon,
i’trated by him: and so certain it mui’t be: because
there can be no certainty in them, if this be not
true. i - ‘ '

The great aﬁjeﬂio‘n against: all this is taken from
the manyinstances of false reasoning and ignorance,
with which the practices, difcourses’, writings of
mankind are too juﬂzly taxed. But, in answer to it,
I would have, it minded, that I do not say, men
may nor by virtue of their freedom break off their

not be unprovided of a competent flock of pne-

other things) they may not be ignorant of the very
nature of reasoning, and what it is that gives li-

may not want philosophy, hiftory, or other learn:

Probability, or that, which in this case may in-
cline one to believe any proposition to be true ra-
ther than false, or any thing to be rather than not
to be, or the contrary, .will generally lhew itself up-
on the application of these and such like rules.~
I. That may be reckoned probable, which, in the
el’timation of reason, appears to be more agreeable
to the canﬂitutz'on of nature. No body can certain-
ly foretell, that [ice-ace will come up upon two
dies fairly thrown before ambsvace: yet any one
would choose to lay the former, because in nature
there are twice as many chances for that as for the
Other. If a [trolling wolf should light upon a lamb,
it is not evidently known, that he will tear the
lamb : but there is such a natural propenfion in that
kind to do it, that no body would much question
the event. (This instance'might have been taken
from amonglt men, who are generally, as far as
they can be, wolves one to another.) If a parent
causes his child to be inﬂruéted in the foundations
of useful learning, educates him virtuously, and
gives him his [hit impulfe and direction in the
way to true happiness, he will be more likely to
proceed and continue in it 3 . than he would be to
hit upon it, and continue in'it too, if he was left
to himself to be carried away by his own pactions,
or the influence of those people, into whose hands
he might fall, the bias of the former lying towards
vice, and misery in the end, and the plurality of .
the latter being either wicked or ignorant or both.

ons all gone to a man, and the same enemies, that
have laid them proﬁrate, i’till purfuing their vitic-
rier. These and such like, tho in ﬁriétnefs perhaps
not certainties, are juftly current for such. So great
is their probability. There are other obfervations,
which, tho not so infallible as those, deserve yet to
be thought of, and to have a Ihare in the direc-
tion of our judgments. Ex. gr. There have been
men in the world and no doubt still are, who, hav-
ing had opportunities of impoiing falﬁties upon
mankind, of cheating, or committing other wick-
ednefs, have yet in fpite of temptation preserved
their integrity and virtue: but, since opportunity
has so feldom faild ,to corrupt them who have been
in polleﬂion of her, and men’s interei’ts and path-
ons continue in general the same, it is more pro-
bable her charms will Ptill have the same power

when there is no particular reason for the contrary,
what has oftneft happend, may from experience
moit reasonably be expected to happen again. , 3.

the ﬁr]! is that which deserves the principal re-
gard: the other two are of use, when nature so uta
terly excludes us from her bofom, that no oppor-
tunity is allowed of making a judgment. Laﬁly,
when nature, the frequent repetition of the same
' event, and the opinion of the belt judges concur
to make any thing probable, it is so in the higheﬁ:
degree.

It appears from what has been said concerning
the nature and foundations of probability, that the
force of it results from obfervation and reason to-

ther. For here the one is not sufficient without-
the other. reason without obfervatian wants mat-
ter to” work upon: and obfervations are neither to
be made juﬂly by ourfelves, nor to be rightly cho-
fen out of those made by others, nor to be aptly
applied, without the aﬂif’cance of reason. Borh to-
gether may sUpport opinion and practice in the

all their days, mui’t be supposed to have greater
knowledge and experience, than others can usually
have: and therefore, if through want of capacity
or honei’ty they do not either lose, or belie their
opportunities and experience, they are in refpeﬂ:
of th’ofe things, to which they have been bred and
inured, more to be relied upon. And, lai’tly, Inﬂa-
rie: written by credible and indufirious anthers,
and red with judgment, may fupply us with ex-
amples, parallel cases, and general remarks, profit-g
able in forming our manners, and Opinions too.
And by the frequent perusal of them, and medi~
tation upon them a dexterity in judging of dubious
earths is acquired. Much of the temper of man-
kind, much of the nature and drift of their counv
fels, much of the course of Divine providence is
visible in them. .
To conclude; that we ought to follow proéabi-
lit], whenfcertainty leaves us, is plain: because
then it becomes the only light and guide we have.
For unless it is better to wander and ﬂuctuate in
abfolute uncertainty than, to follow such a guide;
unless it be- reasonable to put out our candle, be,
caqu we have not the light'of the fun, it must: be
reasonable to direct our ﬂeps by probability, when
we have nothing clearer to walk by. And if it be
reasonable, we are obliged to do it by’ prop. XL
When there is nothing above probability, it does
govern; when there is nothing. in the appoﬁte
,ﬂcale, or nothing of equal weight, this in thecourse
'of naturemui’t turn the beam. Tho a man, to re,-
fumethe instance before, cannotdemonftrate that

at all) to lay on that side : nor could he not choose
to do it. Tho he would not be certain of the chance,
he would be certain of his own obligation, and on
which side it lay. - ,

Here then is another way of discovering, if not
truth, yet what in practice may be supposed to be
truth. That is, we may by this way discover, whe-
ther such propositions as these be true, I ought to
do this, rather than that; or, to think so, rather
than the contrary. ‘ _

Ohf..I have done now what I chiefly intended
here. But, over and above that, we may almoil:
from the premiHES collect,

Firﬂ, the principal causes of error, which I take
to be such as these. 1. Want of faculties; when
men pretend to judge of things above them. As
some (ﬁraying out of their proper element, and
falling into the dark, where they find no idea: but
their own dreams, come to) aﬁ’ert what they have
no reason to aﬁert: so others deny What there is
the highei’c reason to believe, only because they
- cannot comprehend it. 2. Want of due reflection up-
on those idea: we have, or may have: by which it
comes to pals, that men are deﬁitute of that know-‘-
ledge, which is gaind by the contemplation of
them, and their relations; mifapply names, con;
fusedly : and sometimes deal in a set of words and
phrases, to which no idea: at all belong, and which
have indeed no meaning. Of kin to this is, 3.
Want of proper qualiﬁcations and warwexipara.
As, when illiterate people invade the provinces of
fcholars ; the half-letterd are forward, and arrogate
to themselves what a mode/i, ﬂudious man dares

not “, tho he knows more; and fcholars, that have
conﬁned themselves to one fort of literature, lanch
out into another: unfuccefsfully all. 4.. Not un-
deri’tanding in what the nature and force of a juit
ton/Equine conﬁits. Nothing more common than
to hear people aﬂ'ert, that such a thing follows from
such a thing; when it does not follow: i.e. when
such a confequence is founded in no axiom, no
theorem, no truth that we know of. 5. Defects of
memory and imagination. For men in reasoning.
make much use of these: memory is upon many
occasions consulted, and sometimes draughts made
upon the pbantaﬁ'. If then they depend upon these,
and these happen to be weak, clouded, perverted
any way, things may be misrepresented, and men
'led out of the way i by mif-shapen appari‘tions.
There ought to be therefore a little di/iruﬁ of these

faculties, and such proper helps ought to be used,
as perhaps the bdijudgment: want the moit. 6. At-_

tributing too much to ﬂnﬁ. For as neceITary as ‘
our senses are to us, there are certainly many

things, which fall not within their notice; many,

which cannot be exhibited after the manner of fen-
ﬁble objeéts, and to which no images belong. Eve-
ry one, who has but juit saluted the mathema—

‘tics and philosophy, mui’t be convinced, that there

are many things in nature, which seem abfurd to

sense, and yet must be admitted. 7. Want of re---

falsity ﬂipped into the case will ferment, and fpread
itself : an artificial color may deceive one : an in-
cumberd manner may perplex one. The question
ought to be presented before its judge clean, and
hits natural f’cate, without difguife or diﬂortion.
To this laft may be subjoined another cause, nearly
allied to it; not fixing the sense of terms, and
(which must often follow) not rightly underi’tand-
ing what it is, that is to be examind and resolved.
Secondbr, the reason why the many are commonly
in the wrong and so wretchedly misjudge things.
The generality of people are not sufficiently prea
pared, by a proper education, to find truth by
reasoning. And of them, who have liberal edu-
catiOn, some are soon immerfed and bit in plea-
fures, or at leaf: in fafhionable methods of liv--
ing, rolling from one viﬁt or company to ano-
ther ‘1, and flying from nothing so much as from
themselves and the. quiet retreats proper for me-‘-
ditation and reasoning: others become involved
in business and the intricate affairs of ~ life, which
demand their attention, and ingross their time :.
others fall into a ﬂothful neglect of their ﬂudies
and difuse of what they have learnt, or want help
and means to proceed, Or onlyidesign to deceive
life and gratify themselves with the amusements
and fenfual parts of learning: and others there are,-

dating them to their situation in the world, and
the conditions of that employment, by which they
are to get their bread, before they have ever con-
ﬁderd them; and then making the fubfequent bu-
ﬁnefs of their lives todispute for them, and main-
tain them, right or wrong. If such men happen to
be in the right, it is luck, and part of their por.
tion, not the effect of their improvements : and if
they happen to be in the wrong, the more they
ftudy, and the more learning they get, the more
they are confirmed in their errors; and having set
out with their backs upon truth, the further they
go, the more they recede from it. Their know-
ledge is a kind of negative quantity, so much worse
or less than no knowledge. Of this fort there are
many: and very few indeed (with respect to the
bulk of mankind), whose determinations and te-
aent: were ever in the form of questions: there
could not otherwise be [0 many feéts and different
denominations of men, as there are, upon the face .
of the earth. The sum of all in a few words is this :
. many qualiﬁcations are requiﬁte in order to judge
of some truths, and particularly those which are of
greatq/i importance : proper learning and penetration,
vacancy from bufinefs, a' detachment from the in-
tereﬂ: of all parties, much sincerity and a perfect
rgﬁgnatz’on to the government of reason and force of
truth; which are things not to be reconciled with
the usual ignorance, pactions, tumultuary lives,
and other circumstances which carry molt men

SE CT. IV. 0f the Obligations of imperﬁét Be-’
ing: with reﬁeﬁ to thein power of acting.

, ‘ HER E remains yet another quei’tion, sup-

'pofed also to be proposed by an objeétor,
which must: not be forgot ; and upon which I shall
beﬁow this very 'short feétion. The queftion was
this, If a man can find out truth, may he not want,
the power of atting agreeably to it .?

I. Nothing is capable of no ohligati'on. For to Ob!
lige nothing is the same as not to oblige.

II. So far as any being has no power, or opportn:
nity'of doing any thing, so far is that being incapable
of any ohltgation to do it : or, no being is capahle of
any ohltgation. to do that, which it has not power or
opportunity to do. For that being, which has not
the faculties or opportunity neceffary to the doing
of any thing, is .in refpeél: of that thing a being jut-
terly unactive, no agent at all, and therefore as to
that ad: nothing at all.

To require or command one to do any thing is
to require him to apply a power superior t6 (the
reﬁi’tence to be met with in doing it. To require
him to apply such a power is the same as to ‘ re:
quite that his power of such a kind and degree he
applied. But if he has no such power, then his .
power of that kind and degree is nothing : and it is
nothing, that is required to be applied. Therefore
nathing is required to be done. It is just the same;
as if a man was commanded to do something with
his third hand, when he has but two: which would

. , i be

no Tbe Reunion of NATURE; Scét. IV.

be the same as to bid him to do it with no hand,
or not bid him do it. ' .
Without more ado, it is a truth confeft by every
body, that no body is obliged to impoﬂibilities.
- From hence will follow, after the manner of co‘
nollaries, the two following propositions;

III. Inanimate and unabtive beings are capable
no obligation : nor merely fenﬂtive of any obligation
to all upon principles, or motives above fen/2’.

lIV. T be obligations of beings intelligent and aﬂive
must be proportionable to tbeir faculties, powers, op.

portunities; and not more.

V. T o endeavor mayﬁtly express tbc u]? of all the
opportunities and powers, that any intelligent and ac-
tive, but imperfebt, being batb to all. F on: to endea-
vour is to do what one can : and this as every
ﬁach» being may do, wherever he slands in die feale
of imperfects, so none can do more. Om: may exert
his endeavors with. greauer advantage or fuccefs,
than another ; yet ftill they are but endeavors.

. VI; Tbe imputation: of moral good and evil to be.
ings capable of underﬂanding and ailing mu/l be in prai-
portion to their endeavors : or, tbeir obligations reacb’,
as. far as.’ their endeavors may. This follows again
from what has been said: and so doesthis,

VII. and laﬂly, Tbey who are capable of di corni-
ing truth, tbo not all truths, and of ailing conformi-
'ablyto it, tbo not always or in all cases, are never;

what it is. K ' '- ' .

Thus thegeneral duties of rational beings, men-
tiond in or resulting from the preceding feétions;
are brOUght together,_ and finally fixed under the for.
reﬁien or limitation in this left .proposition._ This
is the fum of their religion, from thich no ex.

who have no neceﬁity imposed upon them by Him
to act either this or that way. But yet however
Ithefe free agent: must depend upon Him arﬂteb:
from Him they derive their power of aeting: and,
it is He, who permits them to use their liberty ;

it amiss. And, laﬁly, as to the nature of those rela-

ﬂz‘ng, or “which arise from facts already done and
pdﬁ, these result from the natures of the things
themselves: all which the Supreme being either
' causes, or permits (as before). For since things can
be but in one manner at once, and their mutual re-
lations, ratio’s, agreements, disagreements, (9’6.
are nothing but their manners of being with refpeél;
to each other, the natures of these relations will be
determined by the natures of the things. i _
From hence now it appears, that whatever ex-

Since it has bew already proved, that corporeity
is inconsistent with Divine perfection, tho matter
should be inﬁnitely extended, or there should be an
inﬁnite quantity of it, yet I’till where ever it is, it
carries this incon/iﬂence along with it.

If to matter be added inﬁnite duration, neither
does this alter the nature of it. This only supposes '
it to be eternally what it is, i.e. eternally incapable
of Divine perfection. A

And if to it you add the ideas of bath inﬁnite ex~

long as matter is matter, it must: always and every

'136 The R'ELIGION of NATURE. Se&.V.

XIII. It is [o far from being true that God is cor--
poreal, that there could he no such thing as eithet‘
matter or motion,  there was not fonze Superior he-f
ing, upon whom they depended. Or, God is such a he-'
ing, that without Him there could he neither matter
nor motion. ‘ This mui’t be true of matter : becaqu it
has been proved already, that there can be hut one
independent being; that he is incorporeal; and that
the exil’tence of all other beings must depend upon-
Him. But the same thing may be proved other-r
wife. If matter (I mean the exil’tence of it) does
not depend~upon something above it, it muit be
an independent being; and if an independent be-
ing, a necessary being; and then there could be
no such thing as a vacuum : but all bodies must be
~perfett‘ly solid ; and, more than that, the whole
world could be but one such body, ﬁve times as
firm as brafs, and incapable of all mOtion. For that
being which exists neceﬂ'arily does neceﬂ'arily exi/t :
that is, it cannot not exi/t. But in a vacuum matter
does not exil’t.

Moreover, if matter be an independent, necef—
fary being, and edits of itself, this must be true of
every particle of it: and if so, there could not only

madneﬂ'es, wickedneﬁ'es that are in the world, are in God ;
then all things done and fuii’erd are both done and fufi'erd by
Him ; He is both cause andeii‘eé‘t :~He both willes and nilles,
affirms and denies, loves and hates the same things at the same
time, 537 c. That such gross Atheiﬁn as this should ever be
falhionablel Atheifm: for certainly when we inquire, whether
there is a God, we do not inquire, whether we ourfelves and
all other things which are visible about us do exi/t.‘ something
different from them mull be intended. Therefore to say, there
is no God different from them, is to say, there is no God at all,

be no vacuum but every particle mui’t be every
wbcre. For it could not be limited to occupy only
a place of such certain dimenﬁOns by its own na-
ture; since this confinement of existence within
certain bounds implies non-exil’tence in other places.
beyond those bounds, and is equal to a negation
of existenceg. and when cxi/lcnco is elfential to any
being, a ngation of oxiﬂenco cannot be so. Nor, in
the next place, could its exil’tence be limited by
any thing else, because it is supposed to have its exi-
ﬂence only of itself; i.e. to have a principle of exi-
ﬂzence in itself, or to have an existence that is not
dependent upon or obnoxious to any other. '
° And I may add ﬁill, if matter be self-existent,’
I do not see, not only how it comes to be rcl’traind
to a place of some certain capacity, but also how‘
it comes to be limited in other ref/path; or why it
should not exist: in a “manner that is in all rig/path
perfect. So that thus it appears, matter muﬁ: de-
rive its existence from some other being, who causes
it to be jui’c what it is. And the being, who cando
this, mui’t be God. A . '
- It is to no purpose to object here, that one can-'
not conceive, how the existence of matter can be
derived from another being. For God being above
our conceptions, the manner in which He operates,
and in which things depend upon" him, mui’t also
be unconcei‘vablo. reason discovers, that this Viﬁ-
ble world mul’c owe its existence to some invisible
Almighty being; i. c. it discovers this to be fact,
and we must not deny facts because we know not
bow they. are effected. It is far from being new,
that our facultks should dilclofe to us the exiltence
‘ of

338 We RntroroN oan’rURB. Se&.V.

of things, and then drop us in our inquiry bow they
are. Thus much for matter.

_ As for motion; without a F irﬂ: cause, such as has
been described, there could be none : and much less
ﬂab motionsas we see in the world. This may be
immediately deduced from the foregoing para-
graphs. For if matter itself could not be without
ﬁnch a cause, it is certain motion, which is an aﬂ'ec-
tion of matter, could never be. _ ,

. But further, there could be no motion, unless ei-
ther. there be in matter itself a power of hgz’nning
it s or it is communicated from body to body in an,
white fmceﬂion, or in a circle, and so has no begin-
ning; or else is ' produced by some incorporeal be-
ing. or beings. Now as hardy as men are in ad;
mcing opinions that favor their vices, tho never
ﬂ) repugnant to reason, I can hardly believe any
one will aﬁ'ert, that a parcel of more matter (let it
be great or fmall, of any ﬁgure whatsoever, 55:.)
left altogether to itself, could ever of itself begin to
move. If there is any such bold aIIErtor, let him
fix his eyes upon some lump of matter, ex. gr. 3
ﬁne, piece of timber, or' a clad (cleard of all ani-
mals), and peruse it well ; and then alk himself fe-
rioufly, Whether it is poﬂible for him in earnel’c to
Jolie've, that that ﬂone, log, or dad, tho nothing cor-
poreal or incorporeal should excite or meddle with
it, might some time or other of itself begin to creep.
However, to be lhort, a power of ogirming motion
is not in the idea of matter. It is pastive, as we see,
to the impressions of motion, and fufceptiveof it ;
but cannot produce it. On the contrary, it will al«

reﬂ: or motiOn, if nothing i’tirs, diverts, accelerates,
or ﬂops it. Nor is there any thing in all physics
better settled than that, which is called vi: inertia,
or the inertia of matter.

The propagation of motion from body to body,
without any Fin/2 mover, or immaterial cause of mo-
tion, has been proved impoiiible, prop. I.

The fuppoﬁtion of a perpetual motion in a tin]:
is begging the question. For if A moves B, B
moves C, and scon to Z, and then Z moves A ;
this is the same as to say, that A . moves A, by the
intervention of B, C, D, - -.- - Z : that is, Ame:
it/éif, or can begin motion °.

It remains then, that all corporeal motions come
originally from some mover incarporeal -: which
must: be either that Supreme and self-existing ﬂirit
himself, who is'God; or such, as will put us into
the way how to find, that there is such a Being.
Turn back to p. I 14..

If we consider our/211m, and the voluntary mo;
tions begun by us, we may there see the thing ex-e
empliﬁed. We move our bodies or some members
of them, and by these move other things, as they

again do others ; and know these morion‘s to fp‘ring
from the Operations of our minds: but then we
know also, that we have not an independent power
of creating motion. If we had, it could not be so
limited as 'our loco’motive faculties are, nor con-
ﬁned to fmall quantities and certain _circum&ances
only: we should have had it from eternity, nor
could we ever be deprived of it. ‘36 that we are
neceﬂitated to look up and acknowledge some
Higher being, who is able not only'ﬁto produce mo-A

t And if the petty motions of us mortals afford ar-
guments for the being of a God, much more may.
those greater motions we see in the world, and the
phenomena attending them: I mean the motions
of the planet: and beavenév goodies. For tbrﬂ must
be .put into motion, either by one common mighty
Mover, acting upon .them immediately, or by
causes and laws of His appointment; or by their
respective movers, who, for reasons to which you
can by this time be noﬁranger, must depend upon
same Superior, that furnifh them with the power
of doing this. And granting it to  done eitber of
these ways, we can be at no great diﬁance from a
demonﬁration of the exi/lenee of a Deity.

' It may perhaps be said, that tho matter has not
. the power of moving itself, yet it has an attrac-
tive force, by which it can move Other'parts of _

fecute our inquiries, we still fall in with freﬂi fub.
jeéts of amazement, and freﬂ.» reasons to believe
that there are indeﬁnitely still more and more be?
hind, that will for ever efcape our eagerelt pursuits
. and deepeﬂ penetration. -

This mighty building _is not only thus grand,
and the appearances ﬂ'upendous in it, but the man-
uerin which things are effected is commonly un-
intelligible, and their causes too profound for us.
There are indeed many things in nature, which we
know 3 and some, of which we seem to know’ the
tau/e: : but, alas ! how few are these with respect
to the whole fum? And the causes which we all
ﬁgn, what are they? Commonly such, as can only
be expreﬂ'ed in general terms, whili’t the lottom:
of things remain unfathomable. Such, as have been
collected from experience, but could scarcely be
known beforehand, by any arguments o‘ priori, to
be capable of rendering such effects : and yet till
causes are known after that manner, they are not
tborougloly understood. Such, as seem difpropor...
tionate and too little, and are so insufficient and un-
fatisfactory, that one cannot but be inclined to
think, that something immaterial and inviﬂole must:
be immediately concerned. In ihort, we know
many times, that such a thing will have such an
effect, or perhaps that such an effect is produced
by such a cause, but the manner bow we know
not ; or- but grofly, and if such an bypotbcﬂ: be true.
It is impossible for us to come at the true priucb
ples of things, or to see into the economy of the
ﬁne]! part of nature and workings of the ﬁiﬂ' springs.

and animals conﬁft, are made up of other, fmller

any notion of (as animal spirits, or particles of light),
have their parts, and may for ought we know be
compound bodies : and as to the fubﬂanm' them.
selves of all these things, and their internal conﬂi-
tution, they are hid from our eyes. Our philosophy
dwells in the surface of» nature.

However, in the next place, we ourfelves can-
not but be witneﬂ'es, that there are stated metborb,
as so many set forms of proceeding, which‘things
punélually and religioqu keep to. The same tau/es,
circumftanced in the same manner, have always the
same fuccefs: all the fjmier of animals, among us,
are made according to. one general idea; and so are
those of plant: also, and even mineral: : no new ones
are brought forth or arifen any where : and the old
are preserved and continued by the old ways.

Lai’tly, it appears I think plainly enough in the

parts and model of the world, that there is a eon-
tri'vanee and a rcfpeét to certain reasons and ends.

That jizeb a beautiful scheme, [nob a ﬁll and
geometrical arrangement of things, composed, of
innumerable parts, and placed as the offices and uses
and wants of the several beings require, through
such an immen/e eXtent, should be the effect of
ebanee only, is a conceit, so. prodigiotu 'abfurd,
that certainly no one .can efpouse' it heartily, who
underﬂands the meaning. of that word. Cbance
seems to be only a term, by which we express
our ignorance of the cause of any thing. For when
we say any thing comes‘ by ebanee, we do not
mean, that it had no other cause; but only, that
we do not know the true cause, which produced
it, or interpofed in such a. manner, as to make
that fall out which was ‘not expected. Nor can I-
think, that any body has such an idea of ebanee,
as to make it an agent or really existing and act-
ing cause of any thing, and much less fure of all
things. Whatever events or eﬁ'eéts there are, they
mui’c proceed from some agent 'or cause, which” is
either free or not free (that is, neceﬂ'ary). If it be
free, it wills what it produces: and therefore. that
which is produced is produced with deﬂgn, not by
chance. If it acts neceﬂ‘arily, the event must neeef-
[4715 be, and therefore it is not by accident. For
that, which is by accident or chance only, might
act have been ; or it is an accident only, that it is.
There can be therefore no [nob canfe as chance.
And to omit a great deal that might yet be said,
matter is indeﬁnitely divisible, and the first parti-
cles (or atoms) of which it consists must be small
beyond all our apprehenﬁon ; and the chances, that
must all hit to produce one individual of any fpeeies

of material beings (if only chance was. concerned-)5

must confequ'ently be indeﬁnitelymany : and if [pace
be .also indeﬁnitely extended, and the number of
those individuals (not to say of the fpeeie: them-
felves) which lie difperfed in it indeﬁnite, the ebanre:
required to the production of them all, or Of the
univerl'e, will be the rectangle of one indeﬁnite
quantity drawn into anagber. We may well call .
them inﬁnite. And then to say, that any thing can-

not happen, 'unless inﬁnite chances coincide, is the
same as to say, there are inﬁnite chances against: the
happening ‘of it, or odds that it will not happen:
and this again is the same as to say, it is impoﬂiéle
to happen; sin’ce if there be a pollibility that it
may happen, the hazard is not inﬁnite. The world
therefore cannot be the child of chance ". He

If it should be objected, that many things seem

such answers as these may be made. The use: of
some things are known to same men, and not to
other: : the uses of some are known now, that were
not known to any body formerly : the uses of many
may be discovered hereafter : and those of some
other things may for ever remain unknown to all
men, and yet be in nature, as much as tbofe difco-
'verd were before their discovery, or are now in re-
fpeét of them who know them not. Things have
not therefore no uses, because they are conceald
from us. Nor is nature irregular, ‘or without me-
th‘od, because there are some ﬁetning deviations
from the common rule. These are generally the
cﬁeﬂs of that influence, which free agents and va-
rious circumﬂ‘ances have upon natural producti-
ons -, which may be deformed, or hurt by external

disagree‘able and unnatural motions excited : and if
the case could be truly put, it would no doubt ap-
pear, that nature proceeds as regularly (or the laws
of nature have as regular an effect), when a men/ler
is produced, as when the usual iﬂ'ue in common
' cases. Under these circumstances the monﬂer is the
genuine iﬂue: that is, in the same circumftances
there would always be the same kind of produéli-
on. And therefore if things are now and then mif-
ﬂmped, this infers no uniteadinefs or miﬁake in na-

of some, perturbations; not to say, requires some
variety. The quei’tion is, Could all those things,

in the ﬁrﬂ place, is nothing but a [arias of events,
considered as neceﬂ'arily following in some certain-
Order; or, of which it has always been true, that
they would be in their determinate times and places..
It is called indeed a [cries of can/é: ‘ : but then they
are such causes as are also eﬁﬂr, all of them, if
there is no‘ F irit cause; and may be taken for ﬂab.

causes of their exii’tence, or of their being as they

‘ Seneca says himself, that in this scries God is prima om-

ﬁcult to find out what the ancients meant by ﬁzte. Sometimes
it seems to follow the motions of the beawenbv bodies and their
afpeéts. Of this kind of fate is that palfage in Suetoniu: to be

and the difficulty men find in forming the notion

clude, that there can. be no other ﬁabﬁance but
nutter : and that the find resulting from some dill

it, and come along with it from the parent or pa:-

the parents ; and yet it, the animal itself, may not
be originally begun in them, or traducedlfrom
them. This hyporheﬁs (which has long been mine)
fuggef’ts a reason, why the cbild is sometimes more
like the fatber, sometimes the mother; viz. be-
cause the veiTels of the animalmlnm are difpofed to
receive a greater proportion of aliment sometimes
from the one, sometimes from the other : or the
ﬂuids and spirits in one may ferment and Operate
more strongly than in the Other, and so have a greater
and more ﬁgnal effect. (Here it ought to be ob-
served, that tho what the animaloulum receives from
the father, is in quantity little in refpeé't of all that
nutriment, which it receives by the mother; yet
the former, being the ﬁri’t accretion to the original
' ﬂamina, adhering immediately, and being early in-
terwoven with them, may affect it more.)

Since there cannot be a proper traduﬂion of the
child (one mind, and one body) from both the two
parents, all the ﬁmilitude it bears to one of them
mun proceed from some such cause as I have af-
ﬁgned, or at least not from tradnﬂion. For the
child being fometimo: like. the father, and jomtinm
the mother, and the traduétion either always from
the father, or always from the mother, there must
sometimes be ﬁmz’lz'tude, where there is no traduﬂi-
on: and then if the child may refemble one of them
without it, why not the Other too? The account
I have given, appears, many times at leai’t, to be
true in plants, which raised from the same feed, but
in défirerent beds and foil, will differ. The different
nutriment introduces some diverﬁty into the feed

_ or original plant, and aﬂimilates it in some measure
to the reﬂ: raised in the same place.

The other thing, whichJ take to be one of the
principal supports to this doétrine of traduﬂion (a
ﬁappoﬁtion, that the foul is merely material, or but
she result of some difpolition in matter) has'been
undertaken to be refuted hereafter. But I may pre-
mife this here: tho we can have no image of a [pi-
frit' (becaqu no being can be portraid or repre-
fented by an image, but what is material), yet we
may have reason to aﬂiert the existence ofﬁzcb a sub-
ﬁance °. Matter isa thing, which we converfe with,
of which we know pretty well the nature, and pro-
perties ; and since we cannot find among them any
that are cogitatiw, or such a thing as life, but fe-
veral things inconﬂ/ient with-them, we are under a.
necessity of confeﬂing that there is some 041m fpe-
.cies of fubﬂance beside that which is corporeal,
and that our foul: are of that kind (or rather of one
of those kinds, which are not merely corporeal:
for there muﬁ‘be more than one), tho we can draw
no image of it in our own minds. Nor is it at all
furpriﬁng, that ..we should not be able to do this :
for how can the mind be the object of itself P? It
may contemplate the body which it inhabits, may
be conscious of its own acts, and reflect upon the
ideas it finds : but of its own fubﬁance it can have
no adequate notion, unless it could be as it were
.objeo‘i‘ and fptﬂatorboth. Only that perfect Being,
pvhofe knowledge is inﬁnite, can thus intimateb
know himself. 'i

They, who found the traduﬂion of the foul up-
on this prefumption, that it is mate‘rial, and at:-
tends the body as some part or affection of it, seem
further to be molt wofully mistaken upon this ac-
count: because the body itﬁzlf is not propagated
by traduétion. It 7 past‘es indeed tbrougb the bodies
of the parents, who afford a tranﬁtory habitation
and fubﬁﬁence to it: but it cannot be farmed by
the parents, or grow out of any part of them. For
all the vital and qﬂéntz'al parts of it mul’c be one co-
eml fyl’tem, and formed at once in the ﬁrﬂ article
of the nafcent animalculum -, since no one of theﬁe
could be nouri/de, or ever come to 'any thing, with—
out the melt: on the contrary, if any one of them
could prevent and be before the reﬁ, it would soon
wither and decay again for lack of nourifhment
received by proper velTels ; as we see the limbs and
organs of animals do, when the fupply due from
the animal economy is any way intercepted or ob-
i’trué‘ted. And since an organized body, which re-
quires to be thus ﬂmultaneozfly made (fafhiond as
it were at one ﬁroke) cannot be the effect of any
natural and gradual process, I cannot but conclude,
that there were animalcula of every tribe originally
formed by the almighty Parent, to be the feed of
all future generations of animals. Any other man-
ner of production would be like that, which is
usually called equivocal or fpontaneous generation,
and with great reason now generally exploded. And
it is certain, that the analogy of nature in other
instances, and microchpical obfervations do abet
what I have said strongly.

Laﬁly, if there is no race of men that has been
frometernity, there is no man who is not defcend+

ed from. tWo 157%} parents : and then the souls of
those two ﬁrPt parents could be traduced from no
other. And that there is no such race (none that
has been upon this earth from eternity), is appa-
rent from the face of earthly things, and the bg'ﬂoiy
of mankind 9, arts, and sciences. What is ob-
jected against this argument from fancied inunda-
tiom, royﬂagmtz'om, 69°C. ’ has no weight with me.
Let us suppose some such great calamity to hap-
pen now. It mull be either universal, or not. If
umber/oi, so that no body at all could be saved,
then either there must never be any more men, or
they must begin again in fbmeﬁrﬂ parents. If it
was only topical, affecting some one tract of the
globe, or‘ if the tops of mountains more eminent,
or rocks more firm remaind unaﬁ'eéted, or if there
were any natural means left by which men might
efcape, considerable numbers must certainly fur-
vim: and then it cannot be imagined, that they
should all be obfolutely so ignorant of every thing,
that no one should be able to give an account of
such things as were common; no one able to write,
or read, or even to recollect that there were such
things as letters 3 none, that understood any trade ;

a baldination, or diﬂ'olution, such a total demoli-
tion of every thing. To this give me leave to add,
that tho many. inundations, great earthquakes, vul-'
cano’s and ﬁery eruptions have been in particular
countries; yet there is no memory or tel’timony of
any such thing, that has ever been universal ‘, ex-
cept perhaps of one deluge : and as to that, if the
genius of the language in which the relation is
delivered, and the manner of writing hiﬂory in it
were well understood, bme labord and molimi~
nous attempts to account for it might have been
prevented. And beside that, the same record, which
tells the thing was, tells also how immediately God
was concerned in it; that some persons actually
were saved ; and that the people who then perifhd,
as well as they who furvived, all descended from
two ﬁr]! parents: and if that authority be afuﬂi-
cient proof of one part of the relation, it must be
so of the ref}. 1

This proposition has in efl'eé‘t beeh proVed al-
ready “. However Iwill take the liberty to inlarge
a little further upon it here. As our minds are
ﬁnite, they cannot without a contradiction com—
prehend what is inﬁnite. And if they were inlarged
to ever so great a capacity, yet so long as they re-
tain their general nature, and continue to be of the
same kind, they would by that be only renderd able
to apprehend more and more ﬁnite ideas; out of
which, howfoever increade or exalted, no poﬁtivc
idea of the perfeﬂion of God can ever be formed,
For a Perfeﬂ being must: be inﬁnite, and perfectly'
One: and in such a nature there can be nothing
ﬁnite, nor any tompqﬂtien of ﬁnites.

How should we comprehend the nature of the
Supreme incorporeal being, or how He exists, when
we comprehend not the nature of the mof’c inferior
spirits, nor have any conception even of matter it-
self divef’ted of its accidents P How should we at-
tain to an adequate knowledge of the Supreme au-
thor of the world, when we are utterly incapable
of knowing the extent of the world itself, and the
numberlefs undefcried regions, with their several
flares and circumftances, contained in it, never to
be frequented or viﬁted by our philosophy; nor
can turn ourfelves any way, .but we are ﬁill ac-
cOf’ted with something above our underflanding?
If we cannot penetrate so far into mfetts, as to dif-
cover them and their nature thoroughly, it is not

t‘Ure, who is the Confe, so far above tloem all. The
Divine perfection then, and manner of being must
be of a kind different from and above all that we
Can conceive.

However, notwithl’canding our own defefts, we
may positively affirm there can be none in God:
since He is perfec‘t, as we have seen, He cannot be
deﬁettive or imperfeﬂ. This needs no further proof.
But what follbws from it, I would have to be well
Underﬂood and rememberd: viz". that from Him
mui’t be removed want of life and affinity, ignoa
rance, impotence, oﬂing inconsistently wit/o feet/on and
trut/o, and the like. Because these are clcfezftsg defeét
of knowledge, power, 63c. These are defeé‘ts and
blemishes even in us. And tho- his perfeé’cion is
aboveall our ideas, and- of a different kind from
the perfeélzions of men or any ﬁnite beings; yet
what would be a defeét in tloem, would be much
. more such in Him, and can by no means be all

Though we underf’tand not His manner of
knowing things ; yet ignorance being uniform and

deny that to belong to Him. The like may be laid
with respect to His power, or manner of operat-
ing, 65c. And when we fpeak of the internal eﬂen-

power, which He does not know or cannot do,
He adds without beginning and end, 8e. and
thus we keep still within the limits allowed by the
proposition ". That is, we may speak that with-g
out pretending to comprebend His nature. And so,

produﬁz'on and government of the world, and may
draw eonelzg/ions from His works, as they are called,

Callfe this we can do without comprehending the
manner of His existence. Nay, the contemplation
of His works leads us into a necessity of owning,
that there must: be an incomprehenﬁble Being at
the head of them.

Though I do not comprehend the mode, in which
the world depends upon Him and He influences
and disposes things, because this enters into His
nature, and the one cannot be understood without
the other: yet if I see things, which I know cannot
be ﬂlf-exz'ﬂent, and observe plainly an economy and
deﬂgn in the disposition of them, I may conclude
that there is same Being, upon whom their existence
does depend, and by whom they are modeld ~, may
call this Being G OD, or the Author and Gover-

XVIII. God, «who gives existence to the world,
does also govern it by Hi: providence. Concerning
this grand queltion, W betber there is a Divine pro-
bidence, or not, I use to think, for "yr/Elf, after the
following manner.

Fiﬁ}, The world may be said to be governed (at
least cannot be laid to be dquégvan, or left to.
ﬂuctuate fortuitoufly), if there are laws, by which
natural can/2’: act, the several pbanomena in it fucy
coed regularly, and, in general, the conl’titution of
things is preserved : if there are rules observed' in-
the produé‘tion of mos, trees, and the like: if the
several kinds of animal: are, in proportion to their
several degrees and stations in the animal king- '
dom, furnishd with faculties proper to a’ireﬂ and dc.
termin their actions; and when they act accord-
ing to them, they may be laid to follow the law
of their nature: if they are placed and prooidedfor-
fuitably to their refpeélzive natures and wants 2, or
(which amounts to the same thing) if their natures
are adapted to their circumstances “: if, lallly,‘
particular case: relating to rational beings are taken
care of in such a manner, as will at lalt agree belt
with reason.

in Mar. rebel. (a leaf's falling from a tree, a fpider‘s catching

Second! , If there are such laws and proviﬂons,
they can come originally from no other being, but
from Him who is the ﬂntbor of nature. For those
laws, which result from the nature: of things, their
properties,.and the use of their faculties, and may
be said to be written upon the things themselves,
can be the laws of no other: nor can those things,
whose very being depends upon God, will under
any condition repugnant to His will ; and therefore
can'be subject to no laws or dispositions, which
He would not have them be subject to; that is,
which are not His. Befide, there is no other being
capable of impoﬁng laws, or any scheme of go-
vernment upon the world; becaqu there is no
other, who is not himselfpart of the world, and
whose own exist‘ence does not depend upon Him.

Third! , By the providence of God I mean His go-
VCrning the world by fuel). laws, and making fucb
proviﬁons, as are mentioned above. So that if there
are fneb, there is a Divine providence. A

Laﬂly, It is not impossible, that there should be
[nob : on the contrary, we have juf’t reasons to be-
lieve there are. It would be an abfurd aﬂ‘ertion to
say, that any thing is impoﬁole to a being whose na-
ture is inﬁnitely above our comprehenlion, if the
terms do not imply a eontmdiﬂion : but we may with
confidence affert, that it isimpoﬁéle for any thing,
whose existence ﬂows from such a being, ever to
grow so far'out of His reach, or be so emancipated
from under Him, that the manner of its existence
should not be regulated and determined by Him.

perfevere to go the same circuits over and over by
a certain law. Little bodies or particles, of the
same kind, observe continually the same rule: of ‘
attracting, repelling, 556. 'When there are any
feeming variations in nature, they proceed only
from the diﬂ’eren’t circumf’cances and ' combina-g
ons of things, acting all the while under their an-
cient laws. We are so far acquainted with the law:
of gravitation and motion, that we are able to cal-
culate their eﬁ'eé’ts, and serve ourfelves of them,
‘fupplying upon many occasions the defect of power
in ourfelves by mechanical powers, which never
fail to answer according to the eﬂabliybment. Briefly,
'we see it so far from being impossible, that the in-
animate world should be governd bylaws, that all
the parts of it are obnoxious to law: by them in-
violalle.

As to vegetables, we see also how they are deter-
mind by certain method: prefcribed them. Each
fort. is produced from its proper feed, has the
same texture of ﬁbres ; is nouriihd by the same kind
of juices out of the earth, digefted and prepared
by the same kind of velTels, Es’e. Trees receive an-
nually their peculiar liveries, and bear their proper
fruits : ﬂowers are dreﬁ, each family, in the same
colors, or diverlify their falhions after a certain
manner proper to the kind, and breathe the same
elI'ences: and both these and all other kinds ol-
serve their feafons, and seem to have their several
professions and trades appointed them, by which
they produce such food and manufactures (pardon
the rataelareﬂr), as may fatirﬁv tlie wants of ani-
mals. Being so very neceﬂ'ary, they, or at least the

nerally dpfmoNksat: being liable to a great con-
fumption both of them and their feeds, they yield
great quantities of these, in order to repair and mul-
tiply their race, 8:. So that here is evidently a re.

whatever it is, that proceeds thus in a manner so

like to that of vegetables, according to fix! me-
thods, and keeps in the same general track as they
do, may be said to observe and be under some like
rule or law, which either operates upon and limits
it ab extra, or was given it with its nature. But
there are, moreover, certain obligations resulting
from the several degrees of reason and sense, or
sense only, of which we cannot but be conscious in
ourfelves, and ,observe some faint indications in.

organs and faculties adapted to their respective cir-
cumi’cances and opportunities of finding their pro-
per food or prey, (do. even to the aﬁonishment of
them who attend to the hil‘tory of nature. If men,
who seem to have more wants than any Other kind,
meet with difﬁculties in maintaining life, it is be-
cause they themselves, not contented with what is
decent and convenient only, have by their luxuries
and fcandalous negleél: of their reason made life
cxpenﬁve. .

The world then being not left in a slate of con-
fuﬁon or as a chaos, but reduced into order and me-
tbodized for ages to come; the several species of
beings having their offices and provinces asigned
them; plants and animals fubﬁﬁenceﬁt out for
them; and as they go oﬂ“, fucceffors appointed to
relieve them, and carry on the fclveme, &c. that the
pqﬂdility only of a general providence should be al-
lowd, is certainly too modcyt a demand. We see, or
may see, that in fat? there is ﬁccb a providence ‘.

The great difficulty is, how to account for that
providence, which is called particular ; or that,
which refpeéls (principally) particular men. For
rational beings and free agents are capable of do-

which come to pafs neeeﬂhrz'ly.

. After all, what has been said is only a feeble at-
tempt to lhew, how far even we can ,go toward a
[conception of the manner, in which future things
may be known : but as we have no adequate idea
of an inﬁnite and perfect Being, His powers, and

different from and inﬁnitely tranfcending all the

we knew them in, if He does not know them by
some other way, He cannot know them at all, even
tho they were present: and therefore there must
be other ways, or at least: another way of knowing
even matters of fact. And since the difficulty we
find in determining, whether future matters of
fact may be known, arises chiefly from this, that
*we in reality consider, without minding it, whe-
ther they may be. known in our way of knowing ;
it vanifhes, when we recollect, that they are and
mull be known to God by some other way: and
- not only so, but this must be some way, that is
perfect and worthy of Him. Future, or what to us
is future, may be as truly the object of Divine
knowledge, as pro/out is of ours : nor can we ‘1 tell,
what rcfpeft puff, pro/2w, to come, have to the Di-
vine mind, or wherein they differ. To deaf men
’ there is no such thing as found, to blind no such
thing as light or color: nor, when these things are
defined and explaind to them in the heft manner,
which their circumstances admit, are they capable
of knowing bow they are apprehended. So here,
we cannot tell bow future things are known per-
haps, any more than deaf or blind peOple what
sounds or colors are, and how they are perceived ;
but yet there may be a way of knowing too/2’, as
*well as there is of perceiving toe/e. As they want
a ﬁftb sense to perceive sounds or colors, of which
they have no notion: so perhaps we may want a
ﬂxtla sense, or same fucu! , of which future events
may be the proper objects. Nor have we any more

We can never conclude, that it is impqﬂzble for an
inﬁnitely perfect Being to know what a free agent .
will ekoofe to do, till we can comprehend all the
powers of such a Being, and that is till we ourfelves
are inﬁnite and perfeél: ’. So far are we from being
able to pronounce with any ihewgof reason, that it
is impoﬁble there should be such knowledge in
God.
In the lalt place, this knowledge is not only not
limpoﬂilzle, but that which has been already proved
concerning the Deity and His perfection does ne-
ceﬂ'arily infer, that nothing can be hid from Him.
-For if ignorance be an imperfection, the ignorance
of future acts and events must be 1'0: and then if
all imperfections are to be denied of Him, this
Inn/l.
There is indeed a commbn prejudice against: the
. prefeienee (as it is usually called) of God; which
fuggel’ts, that, if God foreknows things, He fore-
knows them infalliny or certainly : and if so, then
they-are certain; and if certain, then they are no
longer matter of freedom. And thus prescience and
:freedom are inconﬁl’tent. But fare the nature of a
thing is not cloanged by being known,or known
beforehand. For if it is known truly, it is known
to be what it is 3 and therefore is nor alterd by this.
The truth is, God fore‘fees, or rather fees the ac-
tions of free agents, because they will be; not that

consider, what a math of wonder: the universe is in
Other regards; what a Being God is, incomprehen-
ﬁbly great and perfect; that He cannot be igno-'
rant of,any thing, no not of the future wants and
deportments of particular men; and that all things,
which derive from Him as the Firﬂ: cause, mui’c
do this so as to be con/iﬂmt one with another, and
in such a manner, as to make one compast fyl’tem, '

Perhaps my meaning may be made more intelli-

foreknow some way or other that, when he should
come to be upon his death-bed, L would petition
for some particular legacy; in a manner so earneﬂ:
andhumble, and with such agood disposition, as
would render it proper to grant his requelt: and;
upon this M makes his last will, by which he de-
vifes to L that which was to be alked, and then
locks up the will; and all this many years before

tion or thought of any such thing. When the time
Comes, the petition is made, and granted -, not by
making any new will, but by the old one already
made, and without alteration : which legacy had,
notwithf’canding that, never been left, had the peti-
tion never been preferred. .The grant may be call--
ed an eﬁ'eét of a future act, and depends as much
upon it, as if it had been made after the act. So if
it had been foreseen, that ’L would not [0 marl: a:
a/k, and had. therefore been. left out of the will,
this preterition would have been caused by his car-
riage, tho much later than the date of the will. In
all this is nothing hard to be admitted, if M be al-
lbwd to foreknow the case 7. And thus the prayers,
which good men Olfer' to the ﬁll-knowing God,
and the nqleﬁ: of Others, may find ﬁtting eﬁ'eéts
already forecai’ced in the course of nature. Which
poﬂbility may be extended to the labors of men, and
their behavior in general.
It is obvious to every one’s obfervation, that in

some measure) rewarded or punishd by the gene-

not conﬁant) attendents and cohfequences of vir-
tue are peace, health, and felicity; of vice, loss
of philofophical pleasures, a diseased body, debts,
and diﬂ‘iculties. Now then, if B be oirtaou: and

'And since it has been proved (p. 137, r 38),
x that all corporeal motions proceed originally from

there are incorporeal fubl’tanc’es, as that there is
motion. Beside, how can we tell but that there
may be above us beings of greater powers, and.
more perfect intelleéts, and capable of mighty

forementioned difficulty. ,;And then, if there maybe
one, it will unavoidably follow, that them‘ is one:
because in. the; defcription of - providence,- 9:317 1;
nothing is supposed with ,respect to partimlarmjér,
but that they should be provided for in such a man-
ner as will at laf’tagree beﬂ wit-b realm; and to al-
low,-that this may be done, and yetrfay, that it is
not done, implies a blafpherny that creates horror ;
it is .to charge the Perfeﬁ being with one of the
greatei’t imﬁﬂim, and to make Him <th so
much as a reasonable being.

I conclnde then, that it is as certain, that there
is a parjécular. providence, as that God is a Being
ofperfeﬁ rec/an. For if men are treated according
to reason, they must: be treated accordingito-what

they are: the Virtuous, the jail, the compastio...

To explain myself by a few instances. When
we ascribemerry to God, or implore His mercy, it
must not be understood to be may like that,
which is called magniﬁer; in us. For tho this be- a

to which we are made sobject for good reasons,

of our present Rate making it necelfary for us to
empaﬁomte each the sufferings of another; yet it -
is accompanied with uneqﬂnefr, and mui’t therefore
nut be ascribed' ﬁriétly to God in that sense, in
which it is used when ascribed to ourfelves. It
perhaps may not be amiss to call it Divine many,
or the like ; to diﬂzinguiih it: and to show, that
we mean something, which, tho in our low way ‘
of speaking and by way of analogy we call it by
the same name, is yet in the perfect nature of God
very different. Or we may consider it in general

that is humble. and fupplicates and endeavors to
qualify himself for mercy, cannot be the same with

God and one that is obf’tinate, and will not fupplis-
cate, or endeavor to qualify himself k : that is,
the same thing, or Being, cannot respect' opptﬁte ‘
and cantradiﬁory characters in the same manner ;
him who does behave himself as before, and him
who does not. Therefore when we apply to the
mercy of God, and beg ‘of him to pity our inﬁr-
mities and wants, the design is not to move His
aﬁﬁiom, as good fpeakers move their auditors by
the, pathetic arts of rhetoric, 0rd hearty beggars
theirs by importunities and tears; but to' express
our own sense of ourfelves and circumstances in
such a manner, as may render us more capable of
the emanations of Divine goodness, and ﬁt to re—
ceive such infiances of His beneﬁcence, as to us
may seem to be the effects of campastan, tho they
proceed not from any alteration in the Deity. For
it may be, and no doubt is agreeable to perfect
reason always and without alteration, that he, who '
labors under a sense of his own defects, honeﬁly
uses his belt endeavors to mend what is amiss,
and (among other things) ﬂies for relief to Him,
upon whom his being and all. that he has do de--

manner of addrefs, with all his care, are ﬁill inade-
quate, and belowothe Divine nature. In Ihort, by:
our applications we cannot pretend to produce any
alteration in the Deity, but by an alteration in
ourfelves we may alter the relation or respect lying
between him and us. .

As God is a pure, uncompounded Being, His
attributes of mercy, juﬂiee, 8zc. cannot be as we con-
ceive them: becaqu in him they are one. Perhaps
they may more properly be called together Divine
ﬂea/on : which, as it exerts itself upon this or that
occasion, is by us variou/ly denominated.

Here it must not be forgot, that merry or mercies
are many times taken for advantages or beneﬁts
V enjoyed by us: and then they are properly ascribed
to God, from whom they proceed as the effeéls of
His beneﬁcence and providence. ‘

When we speak of the knowledge of God, we must:

. not mean, that He knows things in the way that we
do : that any intention or operation of His mind is
requiﬁte to produce it: that He apprehends things
by any impressions made Upon Him: that He rea-
ibns by the help of ideas: or even that the know-
ledge, which in us is molt intuitive and immediate,
does in any degree come up to the mode in which
He knows things. We muﬁ: rather intend, in ge-
neral, that there is nothing, of which He is, or
can be ignorant : which has been said already 5 and
is, I am afraid, as much as we can fofeiy say.

formd any virtuous actions, or such as lit easy

have the tel’timony of the world added to that of
their own confeiences, that they have done ‘well ’ :
and more than .that, if the reputation acquired by
any qualiﬁcation or aetion may produce a man any
real comfort or advantage (if it be only proteétion
from the infolencies and injustice of mankind; or
if it enables him to do by his authority more good
to others), to have this privilege must be a great
satisfaction, and what a  and good man may be
allowed, as he has Opportunity, to propose,to. him-
self. But then he proposes it no farther than it may
be uﬂefal: and it can be no farther useful than he
want: it. So that, upon the whole, glory, praifc,

When we thank God for any deliverance or ina-
joyment, this must not be so understood, as if He
could value himself upon our cermanioa: acknow-
ledgments, or wanted complements, or any return
from us. It is rather a profession of the fen/22 we
have of our wants and defeéts, of the beneﬁcence
of His nature, and the greatnefs or l'eafonablenefs
' of the mercies received: an eﬂ‘ort of a poor de-
pendent being, who desires to own things, as far
as he is able, to be what they are °; and efpecially
to beget in himself such a difpolition of mind, as
he ought to have towards his Almighty abeanaﬂor,

When we are said to be [wants of God, or to
farm Him, or do Him fwice, these phrases are
not to be taken as when one man is said to be fer-

beneﬁcial to the man who is served, and what he
wants, ’or fancies he wants: but nothing of want
can be supposed in God, nor can we any way be

therefore must rather be to war/kip or adore Him
(of which something by and .by). And thus that

could be particularly fwz'ceable to him: and so
they may be said to farm God, or to be His fer-

to conform themselves to the law: which He has
impode upon them ‘. In these senses we pray,.that

and places cannot be equally proper °. Some times
are ingroli‘ed by the business of life, and some places
lie exposed to interruptions. Those of retreat and
[ileum ought to be fought, and, as far as fairly it
may be, contrived. And for this further reason,
because the farther we are removed from the notice
of others, the clearer we [land of all o/tentation :
that‘ is, the more we do it upon the score of truth
and duty; and this is again, the more truly and
dutifully we do it. '

thoughts: but it is upon our own account, and to
make our adoration, tho imperfect at the belt, as
compleat as we are able. (Which, by the way, is
an answer to them, who object againit prayer the
imminent: of talking to God.) This being pre-
mifed, and it being found that we must make use
of words, it cannot be denied that we ought to use
the be]! and properly} we can. This cannot be done in
cxtemparaneau: eﬂ'uﬁons: and therefore there must
be forms premeditated; the by}, that we are capa-
ble of making or procuring, if we would worship
God to the bell of our capacity. As a prayer ought
to have all the' marks of ferioufnefs and being in
earnei’t, it ought to be the plainejl, and at the same
time is perhaps the bank]! of all compoﬁtions. It
ought to take in a general view of what we have
iry'qyd, what we want, what we have done, &c.
and every thing ought "to be exprel’c with metlwd,
in phrases that are grave and pointing, and with
such a true eloquence, as engages all our attention,
and represents our deepg/i sense, without aﬁeﬂan‘on
or needleﬁ repetitions. These considerations have
caused me many times to wonder at those men, who
dispute against: pre-conceived forms of prayer. ,
They, who talk so much of the spirit of prayer,
seem to know but little of it. '

As to the po/iure, that is beft, which bell: ex-
prws our humility, reverence 7, and earnel’tnefs,

and affects us moi’c. Tho perhaps same regard is
to be paid to the customs of the place where we are 3
or of our own country to which we have been most
used. Several nations may denote the same thing
by different geiiures: and we may take these, as
we do their words; i.e. as having that signification
‘ which they put upon them. ' .
Tho I have not hitherto mentioned it, there
ought to be also a public wow of the Deity. F or
a man may be considered as a member of a fodety,
and as fuel: he ought- to worship God (if he has
the opportunity of doing it: if there are proper
prayers used publicly, which he may refort to ;
and his health, 8c. permit). Or the foamy may
be considered as one body, that has common inte-o
reds and concerns, and as fuel: is obliged to wor-
ihip the Deity, and offer one common prayer. Be-
. side, there are many, who know not of themselves,
bow to pray; perhaps cannot so much as read.
These too must be taken as they arr, and confeq
‘ quently some time and place appaintad, where they
may have suitable prayers red to them, and. be ‘
guided in their devotions. And further, toward
the keeping mankind in order, it is augﬂary there
should be some religion professed, and even eﬂab-
lifhd 3 which cannot be without some public wor~
ihip. Andi were it not for that sense of virtue,
which is principally preserved (so far as it is pre-
served) by national form: and baht: of religion,
men would soon lose it all, run wild, prey upon
one another, and do what clfe the word of favages
do. ‘ ‘
But how does this public worship, it may be
demanded, comport with that retreat and prian

recommended above? Anﬂ I spoke there of prayer
in general, to which those circumstances give a
great advantage: but then they are recommended
no farther, than they can be had, and the nature
of the prayer- admits of them. Excuse a short re-
ﬂexion here, which if it be not directly for the
purpose, is net altogether foreign to it.. Tho he
who reads the form of public prayer reads it to
all at thefame time, that all may unite in one com-
men act, which otherwise they could not do: yet
ﬁill every particular person, who minds the prayers
at all, has a Ie'parate perception of the words in
his mind, and tbera  others them, or the-sense
eontaind underthem, with more or lcfs. applica~
‘ tion and ardor. And since no man can be said to
pray any ﬁarther than he does ibis : and it cannot be
known to any body in the congregation belidc
himfeif, how far he doll: do it; his prayer is in
reality as privale, as if he was indode within a
thoufand walls. So that, though there are reasons
‘ for a public worship, yet I will venture to affirm,
that all true prayer is private : and the true feat of
it being in the wind, toward the interefting of
whoﬁ: powers all the circumstances of worship are
mainiy designed to.contribute, it may be said upon
that account to be always made in the molt re-
tired and undiﬁmzed of all retreats 2: nor can
more be laid in rel'peét of a worship, which by the
terms is in other relpeﬂs public. A man may be
present in a congregation, and either pray the same
. prayer in which others seem to join, or same other,

and them capable of diﬂlm‘i‘ properties in 'tlaings (or
drﬂinﬂ subjectr 9" property). That is, B and C are
so distinguishd, or exist so di/llnﬂbr, that if there
be any thing which B can call hair, it will be for
that reason not C’: : and o. «0. what is C’s will for
that rea-fon not be B’s. The proof of this Iput upon

see with the eyes of B: therefore they are eyes only
to B: and when they cease to be his 9w, they cease V
to be eye: at all. He then has the sole property in
them, it being impossible in nature, that the eyes
of B should ever be the eyes of C.

Further, the labor of B cannot be the labOr ’of
C : because it is the application of the organs and
powers of B, not of C, to the effeéting of somen
thing ; and therefore the slalor is as much B’s, as
the limbs and faculties made use of arehis. '

~ ‘ Again, the mﬁﬂ or produce of the labor of B is
not the effect of the labor of C : and therefore this
eEeét or produce is B’s, not'C’s; as much B’s, as
the labor was B’s and not C’s ‘. Because, what'the
labor of B causes or produces, B produces by his
labor; or it is the product of B by his labor : that
is, it is B’s product, not C’s, or any other’s. And
if C should pretend ’to any property in that, which
B‘ only can truly calligis, he would act contrary to
truth ". '

Lal’cly, there may be wary things, which B may
truly call'his in form: such fen/2, or upon some such
account, as no other can: and to which C has no
more right than D, nor D than F, s9%. the property
of which will therefore be in B. Because C has no
more title than D, nor D than -F , 84'. and that, to
which every one bqﬂde: B has an equal title, no one
besides B can have my title to at all 1, their pre-'
tences'mutually balancing and ale/fraying each Other,
'whilit his only remains. And in this case a final]
matter, being opposed to nothing, will be strong
enough to maintain the claim of B.

called his labor. So 1921‘ D‘Wl liJ‘s “ shangers devour his ~

and welfare (or good) of mankind, is ,ineonﬁ/tent with
the law: of batman nature, wrong, intolerable. Those
maxims may be efteemd the natural and 'true laws
of any particular fociety, which are molt proper to
procure the lumen: of it. Because happiness is the
end of fociety and laws : otherwise we might sup-j
pofe unbappinqﬁ to be proposed as the right end of
them; that is, unhappinels to be deﬁrable, con.
trary to nature and truth. And what is said of a
particular fociety is not less true, when applied to
the universal fociety of mankind. Now those things
are mo]! apt to produce happiness, which make the
n2on men happy. And therefore tbofe maxims or
principles, which promote the general tranquilb'ty
and well being of mankind, if those words express
the bappz'neﬁ of mankind, must be the true laws
of humanity, or the bacts of them : and all Inch
practices, asinterfere with these, must also inter-,-
fere with those. It is contradictory to say, that any
thing can be a general law of buman nature, which
tends only to favor the pleasures of some particulars
_ to the prejudice of the reﬂ, who partake of the
same common nature; and efpecially if these plea—
fures are of the lower and orutal kind. As a million
of men are more than one; so in fixing the public
laws of human nature, and what ought to be, or
not to be, they must: in reason be more regarded by
a million of time: : for here we consider men only as
men.

It Will be easy now to ihew, that the tron/greﬂion
of these laws, conducing to the general good of
the world, is wrong and morally evil. For if man-

Other near relations. Here let me be understood
to mean only those, between whom there is no so-
mily relation (or between whom all family relation
is vanifhd). ’ '

In a Rate, where no law: of fociety make any
fubordination or diftinétion, men can only be con-
ﬁderd as men, or only as individUals of the same
finder, and equally Iharing in one common deﬁ-
‘ nition '. And since by virtue of this same deﬁni-
tion B is the ﬁzme to C, that C is to B; B has no
more dominion over C than C reciprocally has over
'3 : that is, they are in this regard equal.

Perform! excellencies or defects can make no dif-
ference here: because, I . Who must: judge, on which
side the advantage lies? To say B, (or _D, or any

..body else) has a right to judge to the difadvan-
tage of C, is to ﬂoppoﬂ what is in question, aldomi-
nion over him; not to prove it. 2. Great natural
or acquired indowmentr may be privileges to them
who have them : but this does not deprive those,
.who have less, of their title to 'what they have ; or,
which is the same, give any one, who has greater,
abilities, a right to take it, or the use of it from
them. If B has better eye: than C, it is well for

should not therefore see for himself, “and use his

his ; and each has the fole property in his own :
so their respective properties are equal. The case
would‘be parallel tothis, if B ih‘ould happen to
have better intelleﬂual faculties than C. And fur-
ther, if B should be stronger'than C, he would not
yet for that reason have any right to be his lord.
For C’s less degree of strength is as much his, as
B’s greater is his : therefore C has as much rig/at
‘ to his, and (which is the natural confequence) to
use his, as. B has to use his : that is, C has as much
right to rqﬂ/i, as B has to impofe or command, by
virtue of his strengthz and where’ the rig/at (tho
nor the power) of reliiting is equal to the right of
commanding, the right of commanding or domi-
nion is nothing. 3. Since firength and power are
moﬁ apt to pretend a title to dominion ‘, it may
be added further, that power and right, or a power
of doing any thing, and right to do it, are quite
different ideas: and therefore they may be feparat- '
ed, nor does one inferr the Other. Lax/My, if power,
4114‘ power, gives a right to dominion, it gives a
right to every thing, that is obnoxious to it; and
then nothing can be done that is wrong. (For no
body can do any thing which he has not the power
to do.) But this is not only contrary to what has
been proved in feet. I. but to aﬂért it would be to
advance a plain aoﬂtrdirjy or oontradiﬂion rather.

For then to oppofe the man who has this power, as
far as one can, or (which is the same) as far as one
has the power to do it, would not be wrong: and
yet so it musthe, if he has a right to dominion, or
to be not Oppofed. Moreover, that a man should
have a right to any thing, merely because he has
the power to take it, is a doctrine indeed, which
may serve a few tyrants, or some banditti and rogues,
but directly oppofite to the peace and general good
of mankind; and therefore to be exploded, by
prop. III. It is also what the powerful themselves
could not allow, if they would but imagine them-
felves to be in the Rate of the weak and more 21:-

this supposes a dominion over him, and the most
abfolute too that can be. In the next, for B to be-
gin to dif’turb the. peace and happiness of C is
what B would think unreasonaéle, if he was in C’s
case. In the laﬂr, since it is supposed, that C has
never invaded the happiness of B, nor taken any
thing from him, nor at all meddled with him, but
the wleole Iran/amen begins originally from B (for
all this is couchd in the word éegin), C can‘have

or, ‘in other words, nothing, which C has not as
much right to keep as B to claim. These two rights
being then at leoﬂ equal, and counterpoiﬁng each
other, no alteration in the present slate of things
can follow from any superiority of right in B : and,
therefore it must of right remain as it is ; and what
C has must, for any right that B has to oppofe this
fettlement, remain with C in his nndiﬂnroed pof-
feliion. But the argument is still stronger on the
side of C: because he seems to have such a property

faculties and powers, which he has; or that the:
Author of nature has given them to him in vain.
For to what end has he them, if he may not a]?
them ?‘ And how may he use them, if not for his
own preﬁ'rvatian, when he is attackd, and like to
be abufcd, or perhaps deltroyd ?

All animals have a principle of fey—prq/ewation,

. which exerts itself many times with an uncontroul—
able impetuoiity. Nature is unzfirm in this, and
every where conftant to itself. Even inanimate bo-
dies, when they are acted upon, react. And one
may be fure, that no poﬁtion can have any foun-
dation in nature, or be conﬁftent with it and truth
(those infeparable companions), which turns upon
nature itself, and tends to it: deﬂruﬁion. .

Great part of the general happiness of mankind
depends upon those means, by which the innocent.
may be saved from their cruel invaders: among-
which the opportunities they have of defending
themselves may be reckoned the chief. Therefore
to debar men of the use of these opportunities,
and the right of defending themselves against: inju-
rious treatment and violence must be inconsistent
with the laws of nature by prop. III.

If a man has no right to defind himself and what
is his, he Can have no right to any thing (the con-
trary to which has been already in part, and will
by and by be more amply proved); since that can-
not be his right, which he may not maintain to be
his right. A

If a man has no right to define! himself against
infults, £976. it mui’t be because the aggreﬁ'or has a
right to ajail the Other, and ufmp what is his : but
this pretenﬁon has been prevented in the forego-

ing

ing proposition. And, more than that, it includes
a great absurdity, to commence an injury, or to begin
the violence, being in nature more than only to
repel! it. He, who begins, is the true cause of all
that follows : and whatever falls upon him from
' the oppolition made by the defending party, is but
the effeét of his own act: or, it is that violence,
of which he is the author, rcy‘leﬂed back upon him-
self. It is as when a man fpits at heaven, and the
fpittle falls back upon his own face.

Since he, who begins to violate the happiness of
another, does what is wrong, he, who endeavors
to obviate or put a stop to that violence, does in
that respect what is right, by the terms.

Laffly, since every man is obliged to consult his
own happiness, there can be no doubt but that he
not only may, but even ought to. defend it (feet. II.
prop. IX); in such a manner I mean, as does not
interfere with truth ", or his own design of being
happy. He ought indeed not to act rel/My, or do
more than the end proposed requires : that is, he
ought by a prudent carriage and wife forecaft to
ihut up, if be can, the avenues by which he may be
invaded ; and when that cannot be done, to use ar-
guments and perfuaﬁves, or perhaps withdraw out
of the way of harm: but when these measures are
ineffectual or impracticable, he must take such
other as he can, and confront force with force.
Otherwife he will fail'in his duty to himself, and
deny happiness to be happiness.

By the same means, that a man may defend what
is his, he may certainly endeavor to recover what
has been by any kind of violence or villainy taken-
from him. For it has been lhewn already, that the
power to take any thing from another gives no
rig/l7! to it. The right then to that, which has been
taken from its owner against his will, remains ﬁill
where it was: he may ﬁill truly call it his : and if
it be lair, he may use it as his : which if he who
took, it away, or any other, .ihall hinder him from
doing, that man is even here the aggreﬂbr, and
the owner does but defend himself and what is his.
Besides, he, who uses any thing as his, when it is
his, acts on tbeﬂde of truth: but that man, who
Oppofes him in this, and consequently aﬂ‘erts a
right to that, which is not his, acts contrary to
truth. The former therefore does what’icannot be
amiss : but what the latter does, is wrong by that
fundamental proposition, feet. I. prop. 1V.

Then further, if a man has ﬁill arigibt to what
is forceably or without his consent taken from
him, he must have a right to the value of it. For
the thing is to him what it is in value to him: and
the right he has to it, may be considered as a right
to a thing. offueb a value. So that if the very thing
which was taken be defiroyd,or cannot be retrieved,
the pmprietor neverthelefs retains his right to a
thing offaeb a value to him; and something must
be had in lieu of it : that is, he has a right to make
repréfals. Since every thing is to every man what
it is in value to him, things of the same value to
any one may be reckoned as to him the same, and
to recover the equivalent the same as to recover
the Ming izfelf: for otherwise it is not an equiva-

' lent.

lent. If the thing taken by way of reprifal should
be to the manrfrom whom it isgtaken, of greater
value than what he wrongfully took from the re-
coverer, he must: charge himself with that loss. If
injuﬂice be done him, it is done by himself, the
other has no more than what he has a right to. To
which add, that as a man has a right to recover
what is his, or the equivalent, from an invader; so
he seems for the same reasons to have a right to an
equivalent for the expenje he is at in recovering his
_ own, for the loss of time and quiet, and for the
trouble, hazards, and danger: undergone : because
all these are the effects of the invaﬁon, and there-
fore to be added to the invader’s account.

What he does therefore is right. And then if he

3. .There are many things, which cannot be pof-

fell: without cultivation and the contrivance and
labor of the first poffeffor. This has generally been
the case of lands : and these are indeed more emi-

nently meant by the word poﬁﬂion's. Now to de-

prive a man of the fruit of his man cares and

fweat, and to enter upon it, as if it was the effect

of the intruder’s pains and travel, is a mof’c mani-

feﬁ: violation of truth. It is afferting in fact that

gives no right, interferes with prop. III. for it

must certainly be inconﬁf’tent with the peace and

bappz’mfc of mankind in general to be left in end-

less wars and ﬁruggles for‘that, which no man can

ever have any right to. And yet thus‘it mull be

if that doctrine was true: becaqu it has been de-

monﬁrated, that power confers no right; and there-

fore the ﬁeﬂ right to many things can only accrue

from the ﬁrf’c poffeflion of them. 5. If B should

endeavor by force (or fraud) to eject C out of the

poITeIIion of any thing, which C injoys, and ob-

taind without expelling or diﬂurlz’ng any body, he

would certainly do that, which he himself would

judge unmet/enable, were he in C’s place. There-

poiTeﬁions is the same as to command him to leave
them, upon pain of suffering for non-obedience.
But this is usurping a dominion, which he has no
right to; and is contrary to prop. V. 7. No man
can expel] another out of his poﬂ‘eﬂion without
beginning to interrupt his h'appinefs : nor can any
one do this without contravening the truth con-
taind in prop. VI. .This therefore fecures the pot:-
feﬂ‘or in his poﬁ‘eﬂion for ever : that is, it confirms
his right to the thing poﬂ'eit. Lo/ily, the ﬁrft pof-
feﬂor, of whom I have been speaking, has undoubt-
edly a right to defend his per/on, and such other
things as can only be his, againi‘t the attempts of
any aggreﬂ'or (see prop. 11.): therefore these no
one can have a right to violate. And therefore
again, if he cannot be forecany difpoﬂ‘eﬁ without
violence oﬂ'erd to they}, no one has any right to
difpoﬂ'efs him. But this must be the case, where
the poITeﬁbr does not quit his poﬂeﬂion willingly.
The right consequently mui’t remain folely in him,
unless he confents to quit it.

N. The ﬂiccwjor: of an invader, got into pof-
feﬂion wrongfully, may acquire a right in time 2,
‘ by the failure of such, as might claim under him
who had the right. For he, who happens to be in
pofiemon, when'all these are extinct, is in the place
of a prime occupant.

disposing of them is but using them as his. There-
fore‘ the act of B in exebangz'ng them for‘some thing

does C do any thing against truth, or that is wrong,
in taking them : because he treats them as being
what, tiny are -, as things, which come to him by
'the act of that person, in whom is lodged the fole
power of diﬁvqﬁng of them. Thus C gets the title
innocently.

But in the case of eampast the reason, on which
this tranfaction (lands, is more evident liill. For
the contractors are supposed to receive each from
other the equivalent of that which they part with,
or at leall what is equivalent to them rte/joeﬁively,
or perhaps by each party pneferalle. Thus neither
of them 'is hurt: perhaps both advantaged. And
lo each of them treats the thing, which he receives
upon the innocent exchange, as being what it is:
better for him, and promOting his convenience and
happiness. Indeed“ he, who receives the value of
any thing, and what he likes as well, in effect has
it stil}. His property is not diminifhd: the situation
and matter ofit is only alterd. ‘

a To this may be reduced that title to things, which Tillb
mentions as conferred by some law (lege) ;_ and even those,
which a‘ccrue eorzditiene, “ by covenant, ” or ﬁrte, “ by lot.”

.to take any thing from another only because I'
think I. want it, or because I have power to take it,
and will have it, without any title to it, is the
highef’t pretence to dominion, and denial of our na-
tural equality : it is fetting up a right to begin to
diﬂurb the happiness of Others: and lai’tly, it is to
deny there is any such thing as property, contrary to
truth.

Briefly, if there be any thing which P can truly
and properly call bit, then, if T takes or uses' it
without the consent of P, he declares it to be his
(for if it was his he could do no more) when it is
not his, and so acts a lie ‘ : in which consistzs the
idea and formal ratio of moral evil.

The very attempting any instance of injuﬂtice, or
aﬂﬂing others in such an attempt, since it is at-
tempting and promoting what is wrong, is being
in the wrong as much as one is able to be; or do-
ing what one can to atchieve that which is evil :
and to do this, by the terms, must be wrong and
evil. I

Even the deyz‘re of obtaining any thing unjustly
is evil : because to desire to do evil, by the terms
again, is an evil or criminal desire. If the act fol—

and the delire, if any thing renders the fulfilling of
it impracticable, is the act obﬂ'ruéted in the begin-
ning, and ﬁiﬂed in the womb.

Let it be observed here by way of febolion con-
cerning the thing called covetoufneﬁ, that there
seem to be three forts of it. One is this‘here men-
tiond: a desire of getting from others, tho it be
my'u/ily. This is wrong and wicked. Another is
an immenfe delire of heaping up what one can by
just: methods, but without any red/enable end pro-
pofed ", and only in order to keep ‘, and as it were
bury it In: and the more he accumulates, the more
he craves ". This also encroaches' upon truth, and
seems to be a vice. But to covet to obtain what is
another man’s by ju/l means, and with his consent,
.when it may contribute to the happinef's of our-
felves or families, and perhaps of the other person
too, has nothing surely that looks unfriendly upon

not what they are, or (which is the same) as being
what they‘ are not: and this contradicts matter of
faﬂ. *

One can scarce know the fuﬁering: of another
without having at leai’t some image of them in his
mind: nor can one have these images without be-
ing conscious of them, and as it were feeling them.
Next to soffering itself is to carry the representa-
tion of it about with one. So that he, who is not
affected with the calamities of Others, To far as they
fall within his knowledge, may be said to know
and not to know; or at least to cancel his know-g
ledge, and contradict his own conscience.

There is fometh'ing in human nature ° resulting
from our very make and constitution, while it re-
tains its genuine form, and is not alterd by vicious
habits; not perverted by tranfports of revenge or
fury, by ambition, company, or false philosophy P ;
nor oppreﬁ by itupidity and neglecting to observe
what happens to others : I say, there is something,
which renders us obnoxious to the pains of others,
causes us to fympathize with them, and almol‘t com-
prehends us in their case. It is grievous to see or
hear (and almof’t to hear of) any man, or even any
animal whatever, in torment. This eompaﬁon ap-
pears eminently in them, Who upon other accounts

sometimes, when they more coolly attend to things,
in those hardend and execrable man/ten of cruelty
themselves, who seem jul’t to retain only the least
tincture of humanity that can be. The Pbenean ty-
rant, who had never wept over any of those mur-
ders he had caused among his own citizens, wept
when he law a tragedy but acted in the theatre ‘ :
the reason was, his attention was caught here, and
he more observed the sufferings of Hecaba 'and Au-
dromacbe, than ever he had those of the Pbemfaas;
and more impartially, being no otherwise concerned
in them but as a common fpeétator. Upon this oc-
caﬁon the principle of campaction, implanted in hu.
:man nature, appeard, overcame his habits of cruel-
ty, broke through his petrifaction, and would lhew
that it could nor be totally eradicated. It is there-
fore according to nature to be affected with the
sufferings of other people: and the contrary is in-
‘lmman and unnatural.

Such are the circumﬂame: of mankind, that we
cannot (or but very few of us, God knows) make
. our way through this world without encountering
danger: and fuffering many evil: : and therefore
since it is for the good of such, as are so exposed
or actually fmarting under pain or trouble, to re-
ceive comfort and aﬂiftance from others, without'
which they mull commonly continue to be mifer‘a-
able, or perish, it is for the common good and
welfare of the majorigy at lea/l of mankind, that
they should compaﬁonatc and kelp each other ‘. To

do the contrary must therefore be contrary 'to mf-
ture and wrong by prop. III. And beside, it is by
one’s behavior and actions to affirm, that the cir-
cumf’tances of‘m'en in this world are not what they
are; or that peace, and health, and happiness, and
the like, are not what tbqy are. ‘

Let a man fubﬂitute himself into the room of
some poor creature dejected with invincible pover-
ty, diﬁracted with difﬁculties, or groaning under
the pangs of some disease, or the anguifh of some
hurt or wound, and without help abandond to want
and pain. In this diltrefs what reflexions can he
imagine be fboald have, if he found that every body
neglected him, no body so much as pitying him,
or vouchfaﬁng to take notice of his calamitous and
sad condition 9 It is certain, that what it would be
reasonable or unreasonable for others to do in re-
fpeél: of him, he must allow to be reasonable or un-
reasonable for him to do in respect of them, or
deny a manifel’t truth in prop. IV.

If unmercifulnefs, as before defined, be wrong,
no time need to be fpent in proving that cruelty is .
so. For all that is culpable in unmercifulnefs, is
contained in cruelty, with addition: and aggrava-
tiom. Cruelty not only denies due regard to the
sufferings of others, but waft: them; or perhaps
deling in them, and (which is .the moit infolent
and cruel of all cruelties) makes them a jag/l and
subject of raillery. If the one be a deﬁtt of huma-
nity, the other is diametrically opposite to it ‘. If

the one does no good, the other does much evil.
And no man, how cruel soever in reality he was,
has ever liked to be rec/toad a cruel man : such a
confeliion of guilt does nature extort; so univer-
fall y does it rejeét, condemn, abhor this character.

XVIII. The prac‘iice of jnjiice and mercy “is juji a:
right, as injaﬂice, unmercifulmft, and cruelty are
.‘wrong. This follows from the nature of ‘contraries.
Beside, not to be juﬂ: to a man is to be not juit, or
unjuﬂ: to him : and so not to be merciful is to be
unmerciful, or perhaps cruel.

When any one wrongs another of his property, he
wrongs him of what it is to him, the proprietor :
and the value must be set according to what be
eﬂ'eems it to be, not what the injurer, who perhaps
has no taﬁe of :virtuous pleasures, may think it to
be. (See p. 54., 55. obf. 3, 4.) Nor may theie
thefts be excused from their fecrecy. For I. the

out any further views, or any regard to the nobler
part of themselves, is utterly incongruous to the
idea of a being formed for rational exercises.

If all the exception: againstt this separate way of
living could be removed ; yet as mankind inCreafes,
the little plats, which the several families poﬂ'efs,
and cultivate, must be inlarged, or multiplied: by
degrees they would find themselves ﬁraitend: and
there would soon be a colliﬂon of intereﬁs, from
Whence disputes and quarrels would enfue. Other
things too might miniﬁer matter for these. And
beside all this, some men are naturally troublefome,
vicious, 'thieVish, pugnacious, rabid; and theft:
would always be diﬂzurbing and flying upon the

ous, and, if they happen to have any advantage

themselves yet greater or stronger by eating up

length ﬂit]: into their places, according to their
several weights and capacities with refpeél: to the
common concern. And thus some form of a so.
ciety must arise : men cannot fubﬁl’t orherwife.

But if it was poﬂible for a man to preserve life
by him/21f, or with his peril company about him:
yet no body can deny, that it would be inﬁnitely
better for him, and them, to live in a fociety,
where men are serviceable to themselves and their
neighbours at the same time, by exchanging their
money, or goods, for such other things as they
want more; where they are capable of doing good
(fire: each for other in time of need; where they
have the proteﬂion of laws, and a public fecurity
againit cheats, robbers, alTaIiines, and all enemies
to property; where a common force or army is
ready to interpofe between them and foreign inva-
ders; and where they may injoy those difcowries
which have been made in arts and learning, may
improve their faculties by canvarfation and innocent
conﬂicts of reason, and (to speak out) may be
made men.

If, when we have the privilege of fociety and
laws, we can scarce preserve our own, or be fafe,
what a woful condition should we be in without
them; exPofed to the infults, rapines, and violence
of unjuﬂ: and mercilefs men, not having any fanc-
Iuaiy, any thing to take refuge in ? So again, if
_ notwithstanding the help' offriendr and those about
us, and such conveniencies as may be had in cities
and peopled places, we are forced to bear many
pains and melancholy hours, how irkfome would
life be, if in licknefs or other trouble there was no

body to adminiﬁer either remedy or con/clarion .?

_- Laﬂzly, fociety is what men generally deﬂre.
And the inueb company may be attended with
much vanity, and occalion many evils ‘, yet it is
certain, that abfolute and perpetual solitude has
something in it very irkfome and hideous 5. Thus
the focial life is natural to man; or, what his nag

ture and eircumﬁances require.

II. The end of faei'et} is the common welfare and
good of the people aﬂaciated; This is but the confe-
quence of what has been juit said. For becaqu
‘ men cannot fublil’t well, or not so well, .separately,
therefore they unite into greater bodies: that is,
the end of their uniting is their better fubﬁl’tence ;
and by how much their manner of living beeomes
better, by so much the more eﬁ'eétually is this end
answered. .

III. A/eciety, into which men enter for this end,
supposes same rule: or laws, according to which tan
agree all to be governd, with a power of altering or
ddding to them as area/ion shall require. A number
of men met together without any rules, by which
they submit to be goverud, can be nothing but
an irregular multitude. Every one being still ﬁti

therefore no other man’s property is denied by this :
nor is the nature of happiness deniedto be what'it
is, since it is happiness which he aims ,at in doing
this. On the contrary, he would rather oﬂ'end
against truth, and deny happiuefs to be what it is,
if he did not do it; -efpecially seeing, that here his
own happiness coincides with the general happiness
and more convenient being of the kingdom or com-

If the quei’tion ishould be asked, wbot natural
rights a man may part with, or bowfor he may part
with them; the general anfw‘er, I think, may be
this. Some things are eﬂential to our being, and
some it is not in. our power to part with. As. to the
my}, he may depart from them ('0 far as it is con-
ﬁften‘t with the end, for which he does this 2 not
further, becaufc beyond that lies a contradiction.
A man cannot give away the natural right and pro—
perty he has in any thing, in order to pro/ewe or
retain that property : but he may consent to con—
tribute part of his estate, in order to preserve the
re/i, when Otherwife it might all be loft -, to take
his [bore of danger in defence of his country, rather
than certainty periIh, be inslaved, or mind by the
conquci’t or- oppreﬁion of it; and the like.

VII, Mn may become members of o foeiey (i.e.
. do wire: is mentioned in the foregoing proposition) by
giving their eonfent, either explicitb', or implieitly.
That a man may subject himself to laws, we have
seen. If he does this, he muﬁ do it either in his own
per/on; or he must do it by some proxy, whom he
fubﬂitutes in his room to agree to public laws; or
his consent must be eo/leﬂed only from the confou-
mity of his carriage, his adhering to the fociety,
accepting the beneﬁts of its constitution, and ac-
quiefcing in the ‘eftablifhd methods and what is
done by virtue of them.’ By the two ﬁrﬂ ways he
declares himself explicitly, and direﬁb' : not can he
after that behave himself as if he was no member
of the fociety, without acting as if he had not done
what he be: done. And this is the case not only of
them, who. haw: been ancemd in. thc ﬁrﬂ forms

tion of any government, but also of them, who
have in the said manners i given their consent to:
any fubfequent acts, by which they ownd, confirm-
ed, and came into what their anceﬁorshad done;
or who have by oz:th put themselves under obli-'
gations‘to the public. By the [a]! of the three-ways
mention’d a man’s consent .is given indeed impli.
citly, and less directly : but yet it is given, and he
becomes a party. For suppose him to be born in
some certain kingdom or commonwealth, but
never to have been party to any law, never to have
taken any aatb to the government, nor ever for-
mally to have ingaged himself‘by any other at}.
In this case he cannot methinks- but have some low
and [ympatby for that place, which afforded him
the first air he drew; some gratitude towards that
constitution, which protected his parents, while
they educated and provided for him -, some regard
to Othofe obligations, under which perhaps they
have laid him, and with which limitations as it
were they (or rather the Governor of the world by
them) conveyd to him his very life. ,.

" If he inherit: or takes any thing by the laws of
the place, to which he has no indefeaﬁble right in
nature,.or which, if he had a natural right to it, he
could not tell how to get, or'keep, without the aid
of laws and advantage of fociety ; then, when he
takes this inheritance, or whatever it is, with it he

If then we suppose this aﬁettion or fympathy,
when it is permitted to ad: regularly and according
to nature, no reason intervening to exalt or abate
it, to Operate with a strength nearly proportionaole
to the quantity or degree of relation, computed as
above, we may perhaps nearly discern the degree:
of that obligation, which persons related ’lie under,
to aﬁiﬂ: each other, from this motive.

But there are many circumf’tances and incidents
inlife capable of affecting this obligation, and al-
tering the degrees of it. A man must weigh the
wants of biog/elf ‘ and his own family against'those of .
his relations: he mull; consider their fix, their age,
their aoilities and opportunities, how capaole they are,
of good offices, how they will take them, what use
they will make of them, and the like. He, who
designs to act agreeably to tratb, may find many
such things demanding his regard; some justly
moving him to compaction, Others holding back
his hand. But however this may in general be
taken as evident, that next. after our parents and
own offspring W nature directs us to be helpful, in
the ﬁij/t place to brothers and ﬁlters, and then to
other relations according to their respective dif-
tances in the genealogy of the family, preferaon
to allforeigners ". And tho our power, or oppor-

After the same manner I might proceed upon
Other particular virtues. Buc my notion of them
Inuit by this time be sufficiently understood: and
therefore I 111311 only give this general advice. That
you may take the truer profpeé't of any act, place
yourself in your imagination beyond it (beyond it -
in time), and suppose it already done, and then see
how it looks; always remembring, that a long re-
pentance is a difproportionate price for a [hart £72qu-
ment. Or, fancy it done by some otlaer man, and
'then view it in that ﬂeeulam: we are commonly
lharper-fighted in discerning the faults of others,
than of ourfelves °. And further, as to those vir-
rues, which are laid to conﬁi’t in the mean, it may
be sometimes fafer to incline a little more to one of
the extremes, than to the other : as, rather to ﬂin-
ginefs, than prodigality ; rather to inﬂexibility, and
even a degree of ill nature, than to dangerous com-

things as may be hurtful 3 and [0 on P.

mend a strait fortune, or rectify 'an ill constitution ;,
amidl’: so many enemies to virtue, so many'inﬁr-
mities as attend life, he cannot but be fametime: af—
fettea'. But I have said, and say again, that the m-
tural and zrfual efi'eft of virtue is happiness ; and if
avirtuous man should in some respects be unhappy,
yet still his virtue will make him left unhappy : for
at least: he injoys inward tranquillity, and a brealt
conscious of no evil. And which kind of life I
pray ought one to prefer : that, which naturally
tends to happiness, tho it may be dif’curbed; ‘or
that, which uaturally tends to unbappimfr .? In
brief, virtue 'will make a man bare, in-any given
circumstances, as happy as a man can be in those
circumf’tances : Or however it will make him happy
'bereafter in some Other ﬂare : for ultimately, all
taken together, happy he must be.

lb many heroes have triumphed over enemies, even
the greatest, deatb itﬁ’lf; that, which dil‘tinguishes
nations, raises empires, has been the grand theme
of almost all wits, attracts all eyes, opens all mouths,
and aﬂ'umes the name of virtue by ,Way of excel-
l’ence‘; that this should be forgot!

To attone for this omifﬁon I will make this ap-
pendix to the foregoing brief account. If fortitude
be taken for natural courage (2'. e. firength, activi-
ty, plenty of spirits, and a contempt of dangers re-
fulting from these), this is conflitution and the gift
of God w, not any virtue in us : because if it be our
virtue, it must conﬁl’t in something, which we pro-
duce, ordo ourfelves ". The case is the same with
that of ﬁne features and complexion, a large inhe-
ritance, or strong walls, which may indeed be great
advantages, but were never "called virtues 3’. To
have t/aefe is not virtue; but to uﬁ: tiaem rightgy, or
according to reason, if we have them. '

That this is juﬂly said, may Perhaps appear
from what is to be said on the ot/aerﬁde. It may
be a man’s misfortune, that he has not more ecu;
rage, a greater flock of spirits, firmer health, and

up. Luc. 'Apmi p‘e‘v caiy¢7©' 307(3):; “ virtue is the firength of the

them; but it never can be reckoned a vice or fault
not to 21/63 what he has not : for oth‘erwife it might
be acrime not to be able to carry ten thoufand pound
weight, or outrun a cannon-ball.

Fortitude considered as a virtue consists in stand-
ing and endeavoring to overcome dangers and op-
poﬁtions, when they cannot be avoided without the
violation of red/en and truth. Here it is, that he,
who is endowd with natural bravery, a healthful
constitution, good bones and muscles, ought to
15/2 them, and be thankful to the Doner : and he
who is nor so favord, mui’t yet do wlmt be can : if
he cannot conquer, he must endeavor to be pa;
tient and prudent. And thus he, who is naturally
timorous, or weak, or other'wife infirm, may have
as much, or more of the virtue of fortitude, than
the beta himself; who apprehends little, and feels
little, compared with the other, or poﬂibiy may find
pleasure in a fcene of dangerous action.

If a man can prevent, or e/mpe any peril or trou-
ble, falvé' veritete, he ought to do it: orberwife
he neither considers [vim/Elf, nor them as being
what they are ; them not as unneceﬂ'aty, himself
not as capable of being Inert, by them 5 and so dafhes
againl’t truth on the worse side 2. But where that
cannot be done, he must exert himself accordin
- to his eéiZitiet, whether great or little, and refer the
fuccefs to the Divine providence. This is the true
virtue of fortitude, which is nothing but endeavor-
ing firmly and honeﬁly to act astruth require: ; and

more is meant but a fubltance extended and impeo’
netrablc to other matter. And since,’ for this rea-
fon, it cannot be neeeﬂ'ary for matter to think (be-
cause it may be matter without this property), it
cannot think as matter oan.

If it did, we should not only‘ continue to think
always, till the matter of which we consist is anni-
hilated, and so the assertor of this doctrine would
stumble upon immortality unawares; but we must
also have thought always in time past, ever since that
matter was in being; nor could there be any the
least intermiﬂion of aﬂual winking :‘ which does
not appear to be our case.

If thinking, felﬂconfcioufnefs, Ede; were eﬂ'm:
tial to matter, every part of it mui’c have them:
and then no fyﬂem could have them. For a fyﬁem
of material parts would be a fyﬁem of things con-
fcious every one 5) itﬂelf of its own existence and

but there could be no one act of self-confcioufnei's
or thought common to the whole. Juxta-poﬁtion
in this case could signify nothing : the dii’tinétion
and individuation of the several particles would
be as much retaind in their vicinity, as if they were
separated by miles. ‘ -

In the next place, the faculties of thinking,

We not only mam ourfelves Upon reasons, which
we find in ourfelves, but upon reasons imparted
by words or writing from others, or perhaps merely
at their deflre or bare fuggef’t‘ion. In which case,
again, no body fare can imagine, that the word:
spoken or written (the found in the air,_or the
ﬁrokes on the paper) can by any natural or me-
chanical qﬂcieme‘ cause the reader or hearer to move
'in any determinate manner (or at all). The reason,
requeft, or friendly admOnition, which is the true
motive, can make no imptéﬂion upon matter. It
must be some other kind of being, that appreg
bends the force and sense of. them. . \

Do not We see in- co‘nverfation, how a pleasant
thing said makes people break out into laugbter,
a rude‘t-hing- into paction, and so on? These affec-
tions cannot be the play/ital qﬂ’eﬁs of the words
prkeh: because then they would have the same
eﬁ‘eét, whether they were understood, or not. And
this is further-demonﬁrable from hence, that tho
the word: do really'contain nothing, which is either
pleasant, or rude; or perhaps words are thought
to be spoken, which are net spoken; yet‘if they
are appreivmded' to do that, or the found to be
otherwise than ‘it was, the effect will be the [47726.
It is therefore the sense of the words, which is an
immaterial thing, that by passing through the un-
derﬂanding and causing that, which is the subject of
the intellectual faculties, to influence the body,
produces these motion: in the spirits, blood, muscles.

They, ' who can fancy, that matter may come to
live, think, and act fpontaneoufly, by being re-
duced to a certain magnitude, or having its parts‘
placed after a certain manner, or being inveﬁed

with such a ﬁgure, or excited by such a particular
motion: they, I say, would do well to discover to
us that degree of ﬁnenefs, that alteration in the litu-
ation of its parts, ‘ C‘i’c. at which matter may begin.
to finditself alive and cogitative -, and which is the
critical ininnte, that introduces these important
pmperties. If they cannot do this, nor have their
eye upon any particular criﬂr, it is a ﬁgn they
have no good reason for what they say. For if
they have no reason to charge this change upon
any particular degree or diﬁ'erence, one more than
another, they have no reason to charge it upon
any degree or difference at all; and then they have.
no reason, by which they can prove that such a
change is. made at all. Besides all which, since,
magnitude, ﬁgure, motion are but accident: of
matter, not matter, and only the [alliance is truly
matter -, .and since the fab/lance of any one part of
matter does not differ from that of another, if any.
matter can be by nature cogitative, all mull be so.
But this we have seen cannot. be. . ; ,

So then in concluﬁon, if there is any such thing
as matter that thin/e5, &c. this must be, a particular
privilege granted to it: that is, a faculty of think-
ing must be. fuperadded to certain parts or, parcels
of it. Which, by the way, mull infer the exil’tence
of some Being able to confer'this faculty; who,
when the ineptnefs of matter has been well con-
ﬁderd, cannot appear to be less than omnipotent, or
God. But the truth is, matter seems not to be ca-
pable of such improvement, ‘of being made to
think. For since it is not the eﬂénce of matter,
it cannot be made to be [0 without making matter ,,
anotloer kind of fubﬂ'ance from what it is. Nor can it

cidents of matter; and in respect of what else can
any matter. be made to differ from other ‘matter ?
The accident: of matter are so far from being
made by my, power to produce cogitation, that
some even of them show it incapable of having a
faculty of thinking fuperadded. The very'di'vg'fia
win of 'it does this. For that which is made to
think must either be one part, or more parts j‘oind
together. "But we know no such thing as a part
of matter purely one (or indivisible). It may‘in-
deed have pleade the Author of nature, that there
should be atoms, whose parts are aﬂualéy indifcere
pible, and which may be the principle: of other
bodies : but still they conﬁit of parts, tho firmly
adhering together. And if the feat of» cogitation
be in more parts than one (whether they lie clofe
together, or are loose, or in a Rate of ﬂuidity, it is
the same thing), how can it be avoided, but that
either there must be so many several minds, or
thinking fab/lancer, as there are part: (and then the
confequence, which has been mentioned, would re-
turn upon us again) 3 or else, that there must: be
jomething else sUperadded forthem to center in, to

der some’ particular prefpeﬂ, and conform to the
rules of permam ; nor could I otherwise represent
it to myself : whereas now .I can form an idea of
it as it is in itself, and almost view all its bedne at
once, as it were incompassing it with my mind.

I can within myself correfl the external appear-
ances and iinptellions of objeéts; and advance, up-
on the reports and hints received by my senses, to
form ideas of things that are not extant in matter.
By seeing a material circle I may learn to form the
idea of a circle, or ﬁgure generated by the revolué
"tion of a ray about its center: but then recolleﬁing
what 'I know of matter upon other occasions, I can
conclude there is no exaﬂ material circle. So that
I have an idea, which perhaps was raiﬁed from the
hints I received from without, but is not truly to‘
be found there. If I see a tower at a great distance,
which according to the impressions made upon my
material organs seems little and round, I do not
therefore conclude it to be eitber : there is some-
thing within, that reasons upon the circumstances
' of the appearance, and as it were commands my
sense, and correéts the impression : and this must
be something superior to matter, since a' material
jeul is no otherwise impreﬁible itself, but as mate—‘-
rial organs are. Inl’tances of this kind are endl‘efs.
(*v. p. 92, 93.) ' .

If we know any thing of matter, we know, that
by itself it is a lifelefs thing, inert, and paHive on-
” ly; and acts neceﬂarily (or rather is afted) accord-
ing to—the laws of motion and gravitation. This
paliivenel's seems to be (ﬂannel to it. And if we
know any thing of curfelves, we know, that we
are conscious of our own existence and acts (i.e.‘

A a 4. that

360 TbeREuGron ofNA'l‘UREI MAX;

that we live) ; that we have a degree of ' freedom ;
that we can move ourfelves jpontaneou/ly; and in
ﬂuort, that we can, in many instances, take off the
eﬁ'eél: of gravitation, and imprefs new motions up-
on our spirits (or give them. new dire&ions), only
by a t‘bought. Therefore to make mere matter do
all this is to change the nature of it s to change
death into life, incapacity of thinking into c0gita_
tivity, necessity into liberty. And to say, that God
may ﬁtperadd a faculty of thinking, moving itself,
és’e. to matter, if by this be meant, that he may.
make matter to be the fuppo/itum of these faculties
(that fubi’tance, in which they inhere), is the same
in effect as to say, that God may fuperadd a faculty
of thinking to imagitativity, of acting freely to ne-
aﬁty, and so on. What sense is there in this? And
yet so it muﬁ be, while matter continues to be
matter.

That faculty of thinking, so much talked of by
some as fuperadded to certain ﬂﬁem: of matter,
ﬁtly difpofed, by virtue of God’s omnipotence,
tho it be so called, must; in reality amount to the
same thing as another fab/tame with the faculty of ‘

mui’t not all be rather the faculties of some jab,
ﬂange 2, which, being (by their own conceﬂion)
fuperada'ed to matter, must be diﬂerent from it, I
do leave the unprejudiced to determine. "

If men would but seriously look into themselves,
I am persuaded the foul would not appear to them"
as a faculty of the body, or kind of appurtenant-e
to it 3 but rather as some fab/tame, properly placed
in it, not only to use it as an instrument, and act
by it, but also to govern it (or the parts of it; as
the tongue, hands, feet, 8c.) according to its own
reason. For I think it is plain enough, that the
mind, tho it acts under great limitations, does'
however in many instances govern the body droi-
trarily :‘ and it is monl’trous to suppose this gover-
nor to be nothing but some ﬁt difpoﬂtion or am}
dent (fuperadded) of that matter which is governd,
A [hip it is true would not be ﬁt for navigation, if
it was not built and provided in a proper manner :

VIII. The foul of man fulﬁll: after the diﬂolation
of bit body : or, is immortal. For,

1. If it is immaterial, it is indifccrpiolc, and there-
fore incapable of being dissolved or demolished, as
bodies are ‘. Such a being can only perish by an-
nihilation : that is, it will continue to subsist and
live, if some other being, able to do this, does not
by a particular act annihilate it. And if there is any
reason to believe, that at the death of every man
there is always, such a particular annihilation, let
him that knows it produce it. Certainly to reduce
any substance into nothing requires juﬂ: the same
power as to convert nothing into something : and I
fancy they, who deny the immortality of the foul,
will be cautious how they admit any such power.

2. If the foul could be material ; that is, if there
could be any matter, that might be the subject of
those faculties of thinking, willing, Es’c. yet l’till,
since we cannot but be sensible, that all these are
faculties of the [elf-same thing; and that all the fe-
‘ Vera] acts of the mind are acts of the jam Aching,
each of them individual and truly one: I say, since

it is so, this matter must be so perfeﬂly united in
itself, so abfolutely one, as no matter knowable by
us can be. .And then the [raft that can be allowed
is that it should be truly solid, and not aﬂnaliy di-
viﬂble; that is, such as no natural gran/é could
deﬂroy. ‘

To introduce matter with a faculty of thinking,
or a flanking matter, is to introduce matter with a;
new and Oppolite property; and that is to intro-
duce a new jperie: of matter °, which will differ as
eﬂ'entially from therother common unthinking kind,
as any species whatsoever does from its oppolite in
[rain pmdicamentali, even as éody does from jﬁritr
F or thinking and unthinking diEer as corporeal
and incorporeal. And if so, this thinking matter:
must: always continue to think, till either it is an-
nibilated, or there is -a tranfmntation of one species-
into another: and to take refuge in either of these
eXpeétations is at least to expect omnipotence,
should interpofe to help out a bad cause.

If any one should say, that God might by, vir-i,
tue of his omnip0tence fuperadd to certain parcels,
of. matter a fourth dimenﬂan, I ﬂ‘lOUld not perhaps-
dispute the Divine power: but I.might say, that
such matter, exif’ring under four dimenﬁons, ‘

3. The next argument fhall proceed- by-way of
'e'ﬂion and anﬁver.‘ Béeause a removal of the
principal objection again/9 any thing is a good ar-
‘ gument for it. Obj. It items as if thinking was not
eﬂ'en‘tial to the foul, but rathera capacity of thin/Em
ing under certain circumstances. For it does not
think, when it lies coneeald in the primitive rudi-
ment of the man, in the womb, bperhapsin the be-
ginnings of infancy, in Heep, in a fwoon: and the
leafon of this seems to lie in thejcircumltances of the‘
body, which either is net sufficiently attended, and.
prepared ; or for a while implorys the ﬁairits wholly
in the digeﬂion of its aliment, and other offices in
the animal oeeonemy -, or by some external attack,
or the working of some enemy got into it, has its
parts difordered, and thepaﬁ'ages so pofi’eﬁ, that the
blood. land other ﬂuids can scarce break through; ‘
or after some such manner is preternaturally aﬂ'eé‘t-
ed. .And- therefore 'the‘question' to be resolved is
not, whether the fool is material or immatm’al;
and much less, whether it will be annibildtzd at
death“; bgt, whether that fouI (be it what it will),
which-ceafes to think, when the body is notﬁtly dif-
poﬂd, can think at all, when the body is quite d1]:-

From hence then I gather, that the-sfoul pug/hm:

ﬁances and indispositions of the body, in which it
thinks no more, than if the bodywas def/iron ; and
that therefore it may, and will preserve it,- when

pzzcz'ty be preserved for? Certainly not, that -it may
never be exerted. The Author, of nature does nor.
life to aél: after timt manner. 80 that here isthis
dilemma to be opposed to the objection. In ﬂeep
and fwoonings the foul does either wink, ‘or not.
If it does, the objection has no foundation: and if
it dotb not, then all thatmwill follow, which I have
juft now said. '

- If we should suppose the foulto be a being by,

nature made to inform some beefy, and that it can-

not exist: and aél; in a [late of 10va fepamtion; from:
all body; it would not follow; from hence, that:

what we call death, mult' therefore reduCe it to’a

ﬂare of abfolute inﬂnﬁéilz'zy and rinauflfz'vity, which,

to it would be equal to non-exgﬁence. For that body,
which is so necelfary to it, may be‘some ﬁne vehicle,
that dwells with it in the brain (according to that
motive/i: p. 361.) and goes off with it at death.
Neither the answers to the objection, nor the case
after death will be much alterd by such a fuppo/i-
tr'on. And since Iconfefs I see no absurdity init, I
will try to explain it a little further. We are fen-
lible of many material impressions (impreﬁions
made upon us by material causes, or bodies) : that
there are such we are fure. Therefore there must be

there they communicate their several motions (or

the foul, which inhabits it in a peculiar manner,

which it is easy to understand, and perhaps not
very difﬁcult to suppose. . On the contrary, by
many fymptoms it appears molt probable, that
that matter, to Which the .mind is immediately pre-
sent, and in which is its true fbekinab, is not the
whole gross body, but some fubtile body, placed (as
I have said) in the region of the brain. For tbere
all the conveyances of sensible [peeies confpire to
meet, and there in reflection we find ourfelves:
when a limb is loﬁ, the foul, ’tis true, lofes an op-
portunity of receiving intelligence from or by it,
and of ufing it, but perceives no loss in itself: and
tho the body, many parts of it at leaﬂ, are in a per-
petual ﬂux and continually altering, yet 1 know
that the fubftance, which thin/es within me new (or

fhut, and the nerves, being obﬁruéted, or form:
how renderd for the time uselefs, can tranfmit no
information to it. Why however does it not rea-
fon and think about fometbitzg or other? Because,
all the mark: by which things are rememberd be-
ing for the present' choked up or difo'rderd, the re-
membrance of those objeﬂi, about which it is wont
to employ itself, and even of the word: (or other
signs), in which it uses to reason, and to preserve
the deductions and concluﬁons it makes, is all fuf-
pended and 101% for the time; and so its tables bee
ing coverd, its books clofed, and its tools locked
“up, the requiﬁtes for reasoning are wanting, and
no fubjeé‘t offers itself, to exercise its thoughts, it
having yet had little or no opportunity to take
in big/oer objeﬂ: and more reﬁned matter for con.
templation. And to conclude, if it be demanded,
why anyone should imagine, that the foul may
think, perceive, act after death, when it does not
do this in ﬂeep, &c. the answer is; because those

the interposition of the nerves ? The band, which
feels an object at the end of a ﬂaﬁ‘, may certainly
be allowed to feel the same much better by imme-
diate cantaﬂ, without the i’tafi‘. Nay, why should
we not think, that it may admit of more objects
and the knowledge of more things, than it can
now ; since being exposed all round to the influences of them, it may be moved not only by visible
objects juit at the extremities of the optic nerves,
by sounds atithe ends of they auditwy, 8m. but be-
come as it were all eye to visible objects, allege: to
audible, and so on .9 And why should we not think
this the rather, because then the foul may be also
perceptive of finer impressions and ethereal contacts,
and consequently of more kinds of objects, such as
we are now incapable of knowing? And then, this
being so, why should we not prefage, that other
endowments, , as faculties of reasoning, communi-

good reason for it. ‘

But if we can in any tolerable manner (which in
our present circumstances is as much, as can be
eitpeé‘ted) account for the difﬁculties objeéted, and
those the greatq/Z:be1ong°ng to, this matter, and
show how it is poﬁble that they may conﬁft with

of the objection, from .what has been done that

4. We may conclude the souls of men robe im-t
mortal from the nature Qf God. For ifhe is (which
fore nobody doubts) a. Perfect being, He, as such,
can do nothing inconﬁl’tent with perfeﬁ or ugh:
reason. And then no facing, nor dream/lame of
any being, can come from  asits cause, which
it is not agreeable to ' fuck reason should be: or
(which is the same), He cannot but deal red/an-
abe with all His dependents. And then again, if
we are in the number of these, and the mortality
of the human foul does nor conﬁft with reason,
we may be fure it is immortal: as fure as we can
be of any thing by the use of our faculties; and
that is, as'fure as we can be of any thing. Whether
therefore that does cargﬂﬂ with reason, or not, is to
be inQuired. '

To produce a being into a ﬂare .of clear bappi-
rug/s in any degree, can be no injury to it; or into
a sfate of mix: bappizze/i, provided the happiness

' certainly overédlances the contrary, and the unhap-
py- or fquering part be not greater than what that
being would (baa/E: in order to obtain the happiness,

or rather than lose it. Nor, again, can any wrong
be done by producing a being subject to more mi-
lkry than happiness, if that being has it in his own
power to avoid the misery, or so much of it, as
may leave the remainder of misery not greater,
than what he would rather sustain than mifs the.
proportion of happiness. The only case then, by
which wrong can be done in the production of any
being, is, when it is necessarily and irremediably to
be mﬁrable, without any recompense, or balance
of that misery ° : and this indeed is a case so grie-
vous, so utterly irreconcilable to all reason, that the
heart of a reasoning and considering man can
scarce bear the thought of it. So much every one
must understand of the nature of reason and justice
as to allow these things for truths incontestable.
Now then he, who says the soul of man is mor-
tal, must say one of these two things :. either that
God is an unreasonable, unjust, cruel Being; or
that no man in respect of this life (which accord-
ing to him is all), has a greater share of misery,
unavoidable, than of happiness. To say the former
is to contradict that, which I presume has been
proved beyond contradiction. To which I may
add here, that this is to avow such an unworthy, im-

of the torment: and one/lion: of the ancients. Look
into the history of the Christian Church, and her
martyrologies : examin the prisons' of the inqzaﬁ-.

and uponwhat ﬂight occasions men are racked and
tortured by the tormentors there: and, to finish
this detail (hideous indeed, but too true) as fall: as
I can, consider the many maﬂ‘acres, perfecutions,
and miferies consequent upon them, which falﬁ
religion has caused, authorized, fanéliﬁed. Indeed
the 1472on of mankind is little else but, the history of
uncomfortable, dreadful past'ages : and a great part
of it, however things are palliated and gilded over,
is scarcer to be red by a good-natured man with-
out amazement, horror, tears. One can scarce look
into a news-paper, or out at his window, but hard—
Ihips and querings present themselves, in one
Ihape or other. Now among all tboﬁe millions, who
have fuﬂ’erd eminently, can it be imagind, that
there have not been multitudes, whose griefs and
- pangs have far outweigbd all their enjoyments ;'
and yet who have not been able, either by their
innocence, their prudence, or any power in them,
to efcape that litter drought, which they have
drunk? And then, howcan we acquit the juﬂiee'

Men’s eirtnmﬂanees have a natural influence with
respect to ‘the present pleasures or sufferings, as
' well as their virtue or nice. No body fure ever
said, that all depends only upon these: nor,, when
the natural tendenceof them is aﬂhrted, is the natu-
ral tendence or effect of. the other denied. There-E
, fore indeed, when it is said that virtue naturally
tends to make men happy even here, the meaning
only is, that it tends to make men happy in pro-
portion to their circumstances ; and vice does the
contrary. It is naturally productive of that part of
happiness, which is in our own power, and depends
upon ourselves; makes men more truly happy,
whatever their circumstances are, than they could
be without it, and commonly tends to mend their
worldly circumstances too : but it is not asserted,
that virtue can always entirely correct them, or
make men. so completely happy in this life, as that
their enjoyments shall exceed their mortifications;
no more than the vices of some particular men,
tho they bereave them of many solid pleasures,
and bring troubles upon them too, do hinder their
worldly enjoyments from being greater than their
present sufferings. Not only our being, but our
place, with the time, and manner of our being in

On purpose, that from the «0mm compﬁtiom of

There is one thing more, of which notice ought
to be taken. To one, who carefully peruses the
ﬁory and face of the world, what appears to pre-
mil in it ? Is it not corruption, vice, iniquity, fol-
ly, at least? Are not debauching °, getting per so:
aut nefas, defaming one another, erecting tyrannies
'of one kind or Other, propagating empty and sense—
less opinions with bawling and fury the great buli-

to reason .? Can any one then with reason imagine,
that reason should be given, tho it were but to a
few, only to be run down and trampled upon, and
then extinguished .9 May we not rather conclude,
that there must be firm: world, where reason will

men have, of continuing to live in another Rate,
beyond the grave, has I suppose been commonly ad—
mitted as one proof, that they shall live; and does
seem indeed to me to add some weight to what
has been said. That they generally have had such

of mankind, their deifications, rites, stories of ap-
paritions, the frethent mention of' a tales, with
rewards and punishments hereafter, (sic. all tefti-
'fy, that even the Heathen world believed, that the
foul: of men survived their bodies. Their ignorance
indeed of the feats and circumstances of the de-
parted has wgot many error: and fapeﬂlitiom ;‘ and
these have been .multiplied by licentious poet: and
idle ‘vi/ionairs‘: but this, being no more than what
is usual in the like cases, ought to be no prejudice

against: the fundamental opinion itself.
Cicero 9, tho he owns there were different Opini-
ons among the Greek philosophers about this mat-
ter; that, quod literi: extet', Pbereeyde: Syru: primam
dixit, animo: borizinum eﬂe ﬂmpiternosg that Pytba-

Plato was the man, who brought a reason for it,
s3%. yet tells us plainly, naturam ipfam de immor-

Now if this consent was only the efl‘eét of some
tradition, handed from parents to their children ;
yet since we meet with it in all the quarter: of the
world (where there is my civility or 'sense), and in
all ages, it seems to be eowal to mankind itself,
and born with it. And this is sufficient to give a
great autbority to this Opinion of the foul’s immor-
Itality. But this is not all. For it'is supported by

~ This argument grows [hanger in the apprehen-
ﬁon of one, who is conscious of abilities and intel-
leﬂual improvements, which he has had no oppor-‘
tunity here of showing and using, through want
of health, want of confidence, want of proper
place, want of libelty. Such improvements, and
the knowledge consequent upon them, cannot ul-
timately respect this ﬂute: they can be only an
enlargement, and preparation for another. That
is all they can be :' and if they are not that, they
are nothing. ‘ And therefore" he may be supposed
thus, ﬁthher, to argue within himself.« “ Can the
“ Author of my reasoning faculties be himself so

depends) -, laments, and labors against: his own ﬁle

that view : on_e_,who by the exaltation of his reason
and upper faculties, and that, which is certainly
the effect of real and useﬁal philosophy, the prac-'
tice of virtue, is’ still approaching toward a higher
manner of being, and does already talle something
spiritual and above this world. To such a one there
mull be a strong expectation indeed, and the argu-
ment built upon it muﬁA&,prOWMOnable. For
can he be endowed with such capacities, and have
'as it were onertnres of immortality ‘ made him, if
after all there is no such thing? Must his private
' acts and leaneeald exercises of religion be all loll “ ?
Can a perfect Being have so little regard to one.
who however inferior and nothing to Him, yet re..-
gards Him according to may: abilities in. the go-
vernment of himself ?

Are such meditation: and reflections as these well
founded, or not? If they are, it must be reasonable
to think, that God will satisfy a reasonable expat-
tatien. ' I .

There are other argument: for the immortality
of the foul, two of which I will leave with you,‘
to be ,at your leisure pondered well. The one is,
that, if the foul: of men are mortal (extinguishd
at death), the case of brute: is by much preferable
to that of men. The pleasure: of brutes, tho but

fenfual, are more fineere, being palled afdiminiﬂld
by no diverting consideration: they go wbalb' into
them 3 and when they have them not, they shem '
iefs to want them, not thinking of them. Their
fafering: are attended with no reflection 1', but are
such as they are said to be p. 57. obf. 8. They
are void of cams; are under , no apprehenﬁon foi-
families and pofierity ; never fatigue themﬁlves
with vain inquiries, hunting after knowkke which

hopes or expectations'; and at laﬁ same fudden
blow (or a few minutes of unforg/cen pain) ﬁniﬂam
them, having never [0 mark as known that they
wen: mortal. '

The other is, that the foul is a prszch [(79.-
that, which brings vitality to the body. For how

life, ends: [tab ,(as being what itis) ism“ I

not naturally. ,To those therefore mui’t be their

rational faculties ; . but also in the greater or less in-
ﬂuence of these upon their aé‘tions, and by confe-
quence in their diﬁ‘erentdegrees of virtue, or nice.
For a man is accounted a red/enable man, when he
reasons rightly, and follows his reason : in which
expression . virtue must be included, being (as
p. 3 36, s9" 4!.) nothing but the praﬂiee of reason;
and truth. i I '

That men are reasonable, or the contrary, in.
different degrees is plain. Some reason well upon
same subjects, but in respect of others, to which
they have not been accustomed, are dim and con-
fused: or they are partial to their vices and paf-
ﬁons, their old impressions and parties; and so
their reason is not general, nor has its due extent, ‘
'or influence. Others, whose reason is uncultivated
and weak, tho they have virtuous inclinations,
many times fall into fupeﬂiitz’on and obfurdz'tieeg
milled by authorities, and over-awed by old, or
formal modes of speaking, and grave non-sink.
Many, if not the molt, seem to have scarce any
notion of reasonuor virtue at all, but act fortuitous-
.ly, or as they see other folks act; moved either
.by bodily prOpenlions, or by example. Some few
there are, who endeavor to improve their under—
standings, to discover what is agreeable to reason,
and to fix their opinions; and conduct their live:
accordingly. And in all these [were] kind: there
are various degrees of elevation in knowledge and
virtue, and of immersion in vice and ignorance,
and new differences arising endlessly. —All this is
visible.

Now the foul, reflecting, finds in itself two ge-
neral faculties, one, by which it understands, and
judges, and reasons (all which I‘cqr'n'prehend un-
der the "term raiz'omzl faculties; "or 're‘aﬁin) -, ’.ar'id “dit-

can by. no means be redrelt, unless men’s enjoy-
ments and sufferings, taken together with their
virtues and vices, are compared and balanced. I
say, taken together : because no reason. can be af-
signed, why a vicious man should be recompensed
for the pains and mischiefs and troubles, which he
brings upon himself by his vices, as the natural con-
ferquences of them; nor, on the other side, why
any deductions should be made from the future
happiness of a good man upon the score of those
innocent enjoyments, which are the genuine fruit of
his moderation, regularity, other virtues, and sound
reasoning.

Cor. Wicked men will not only be less happy than
the wise and virtuous, out no really unhappy in that
state to come. For when all the happiness, that answers to those degrees of virtue, which they had,
and those sufferings, which they underwent, above
what was the natural effect of their wickedness 5
say, when that is fubtraé‘ted, what remains upon
the account will be something below no-happi-

lie more open, and have more immediate and acute

<li>This is <i xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖν ψεῦδος</i> “to act a lie” (<i>Revelation</i>).

<li>Horace argues after the same manner. <i xml:lang="la">Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet <em>agnam</em>; Huic vestem, ut <em>gnatæ</em>, paret, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>… Interdicto huic omne adimat ius Prætor, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>… Quid? si quis <em>gnatam</em> pro mutâ devovet <em>agnâ Integer est animi?

<li>Sextus Empiricus seems to be fond of that filthy saying of Zeno, in relation to what is storied of Jocasta and Oedipus: <i xml:lang="grc">μὴ ἄτοπον εἶναι τὸ μόρίον τῆς μητρὸς… τρῖψαι, κλ</i> any more, than to rub with the hand any other part of her, when in pain. Here only <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις</i> is considered; as if all was nothing more, but <em>barely</em> <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις</i>; but this is an incomplete idea of the act. For <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις τοῦ μόρίον</i> is more than <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις</i> by itself: and <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις τοῦ μόρίον τῆς μητρὸς</i> is still more: and certainly <i xml:lang="grc">τρίβειν τὴν χεῖρα τῇ χειρὶ</i> is a different thing from <i xml:lang="grc">τρίβειν τὸ μορίον τῷ μορίῳ</i>, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> He might as well have said, that to rub a red hot piece of iron with one’s bare hand is the same as to rub one that is cold, or any other innocent piece of matter: for all is but <i xml:lang="grc">τρίψις</i>.

<li><i xml:lang="grc">Οὐ λέγεις φιλόπονον τόν διά παιδισκάριον ἀγρυπνοῦντα</i> “You will not say that a person is industrious, because he once watched all night with his daughter” (Arrian). <i xml:lang="la">Amico ægro aliquis assidet: probamus. At hoc si hereditatis causâ facit, vultur est, cadaver expectat</i> “A man watches with a sick friend: it is allowed to be a good action; but if he did it in order to make himself his heir, he is a vulture, and watched for the carcass” (Seneca).</li>

<li>Notwithstanding that paradox of the Stoics, <i xml:lang="grc">Ὅτι ἴσα τὰ ἁμαρτήματα, καὶ τὰ κατορθώματα</i> “That all sins are equal, and all duties equal,” in Cicero, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and others, which might easily be confuted from their own words in Cicero. For if sinning be like passing a line, or limit; that is, going over or beyond that line: then, to sin being equal to going beyond that line, to go more (or farther) beyond that line must be to sin more. Who sees not the falsity of that, <i xml:lang="la">nec bono viro meliorem… nec forti fortiorem, nec sapiente sapientiorem posse fieri</i> “that it is impossible for a good man to be better… or a strong man to be stronger, or awise man wiser?” And so on. <i xml:lang="la">Nullum inter scelus &amp; erratum discrimen facere</i>, “to make no difference betwixt notorious wickedness and mere mistakes” (as <abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome expresses their opinion: if that epistle to Celantia be his) is to alter or destroy the natures of things.</li>
<li>Sure that Wiseman was but a bad accountant, who reckoned, <i xml:lang="grc">τὴν μεγίστην οὐσίαν ἀποβάλὼν, δραχμὴν μίαν ἐκβεβληκέναι</i> “that he who throws away the greatest estate, throws away but a drachm” (In Plutarch).</li>
<li>This is confessed in Cicero. <i xml:lang="la">Illud interest, quod in servo necando, si adsit injuria, semel peccatur: in patris vita violanda multa peccantur, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Multitudine peccatorum præstat, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></i> “There is this difference, that he who kills a slave, if it be done wrongfully, is guilty of sin in that one respect only; but he that wickedly takes away the life of his father, sins in many respects, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> He excels in the multitude of his sins, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>”</li>
<li>This may serve for an answer to Chrysippus, and them who say, <i xml:lang="grc">εἰ ἀληθὲς ἀληθοῦς μᾶλλον οὐκ ἔστιν, οὐδὲ ψεῦδος ψεύδους· οὕτως οὐδὲ ἀπάτη ἀπάτης, οὐδὲ ἁμάρτημα ἁμαρτήματος, κλ</i> “That if no one truth be greater than another truth, nor no one falsehood greater than another falsehood; then neither is one fraud nor one sin greater than another” (in Diogenes Laertius).</li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Queis paria esse ferè placuit peccata, laborant Cùm ventum ad verum est: sensus moresque repugnant, Atque ipsa utilitas</i> “They who would have all sins to be equal, labor under great difficulty, when they come to the truth; for they find it contrary to reason, to morality, and to the interest of mankind” (Horace).</li>
<li>Therefore they, who denied there was either good or evil (<i xml:lang="grc">Φύσει ἀγαθὸν καὶ κακόν</i> “good or evil in the nature of things”) were much in the right to make thorough work, and to say there was nothing in nature either true or false.

<li>There was among the old philosophers such an uncertainty and variety of opinions concerning the <i xml:lang="la">fines bonorum &amp; malorum</i>, “the limits of good and evil,“ that if Varro computes rightly, the number might be raised to 288 (<abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine).</li>
<li><i xml:lang="la">Quod honestum est, id bonum solum habendum est</i> “That which is truly honorable, and valuable upon its own account, is the only thing that ought to be esteemed really good” (Cato in Cicero).</li>

<li>It is commonly placed among ends: and is considered as such in those ways of speaking; <i xml:lang="la">honestum esse propter se expetendum</i> “that which is honorable ought to be sought after for its own sake” (Cicero). <i xml:lang="la"><em>Finem</em> bonorum esse honestè vivere</i> “<em>The perfection</em> of all goodness and virtue is to live by the rules of true honor” (<abbr xml:lang="la">ibid.</abbr> and the like).</li>
<li>To say <i xml:lang="la">Quod laudabile est, omne honestum est</i> “what is truly praiseworthy, is truly honorable,” or anything like that, is, to say nothing. For how shall one know what is truly <i xml:lang="la">laudabile</i>, “praiseworthy?”</li>
